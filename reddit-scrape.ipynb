We also dont want sites making up subjects and data because how can we trust our products in that way? That's not to mention that we don't want accidental access to another person's medical records if they never were made aware that we were accessing their information. To ensure that everything is being done in a correct way, there are people like me who pay attention to Date of birth, your EMR, and your consent documents to make sure everything checks out. This is to protect you, your wellbeing, and the wellbeing of everyone using our products either in the clinical phase or for actual usage.

I asked for feedback if there were some skills I was lacking or if I needed to develop certain areas while inquiring further about future promotion, it was explained that my coworker volunteered for special projects (lots of travel projects), while I did volunteer for remote special projects...started applying at other CROs and got an interview with 2 big CROs and offered a position for CRA 2 at both companies. I'm happy that I didn't get the promotion at my old company to get me out of my comfort zone.\",\n",

When you find a job you want to apply to do it and find a recruiter to reach out to. Or do that first, just be sure to do it. One company I interviewed with their recruiter told me to always find one if possible bc that is where they start the interviewing. I just searched job listings and would go to LinkedIn with whatever company and type in \"Company name\" recruiter and see who popped up and woild message them and ask if they would have 5 or 10 minutes to chat about open positions within their company that would match my background. I was also told make sure on LinkedIn that you have your job descriptions with your listed jobs bc they look there. Mine is essentially my resume at this point. And before all my interviews I would practice answering interview questions that id google. Really big is the STAR approach for these companies - so search and practice!

Worked in research as well as an assistant on device trials. Had JUST accepted my first CRC job and was set to start the following week. I went to John’s Hopkins for a blinded ketamine trial for low dose fatigue, ketamine or versed. Not sure why versed but that’s a discussion for another time. I’m in PA so we had to drive to Baltimore. Well I show up, and the lead coordinator that does the infusions had to call out sick to stay home with her child. SO I’m sitting there waiting for everything to start, and in front of me is the PI, another PHD doc from overseas that just does research, and the other shadowing students, completely fumble fucking around as they had nooooooo idea. Finally a random nurse appeared that could help, and got it going. The whole time I’m sitting there chilling, watching them all work and taking mental notes for my job starting! Everyone kept saying, you’re like REALLY CHILL for how this is going right now, are you sure you’re okay???  Lmao yes I’m fine. Couldn’t tell them how funny I found it watching them all run around like chickens with their heads chopped off. Anyways i got the ketamine and was set to come back in 2 weeks and then my appendix bursted. Never got to finish it. They have since called me twice to tell me to come back for two more trials lmao',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'Back in July I took a new job with Syneos while I was closing on a house. Unfortunately, the close took longer than expected and I had to keep my old job at ICON to keep my loan… meaning I was dual employed for a short time… and well.. Both companies found out and fired me the same week I closed on my house… I’ve already confirmed with ICON I can never work there again so I assume the same for Syneos. I’ve interviewed with IQVIA, CTI, Parexel, Worldwide Clinical Trials, Precision Medicine, and a handful of sponsors and I keep getting rejected in the last phase or during the background check. When asked about why I’m looking I’ve tried saying it wasn’t a good fit and I left on my own, I’ve tried explaining the situation in detail and that I didn’t want to do dual employment but had to for the house, and I’ve tried other reasons but nothing is working… I’m officially dejected and took a job as a CRC again at my local hospital but I’m so hurt knowing it could be different. Does anyone have any advice for a broken man running out of ideas?',\n",

I just searched job listings and would go to LinkedIn with whatever company and type in \"Company name\" recruiter and see who popped up and woild message them and ask if they would have 5 or 10 minutes to chat about open positions within their company that would match my background. I was also told make sure on LinkedIn that you have your job descriptions with your listed jobs bc they look there. Mine is essentially my resume at this point.

I found a great opportunity to work as a Clinical Research Nurse in a nearby Site ( I\\'ve been interested for years, loved the idea of clinical skills, science, project management, etc., had applied a few times to various roles, never got a bite). I shadowed and met the team, everyone seemed happy, hours seemed great, they said every now and then a study might \"run over\"\\n\\nI\\'ve been here 8 weeks. Holy hell - I have never worked so hard in my life, not even as a bedside nurse. The expectations for productivity are unrealistic, people slack at all hours, my manager sends me messages at 9pm talking business. I could work 60 hours a week and never feel like I\\'m digging myself out. We are always behind on recruitment and data entry. Working harder only buys me MORE WORK. The song and dance of paperwork for regulatory and GCP all seems made up nonsense to me and just more busy work than is needed. Oh, you don\\'t want to call a subject on Xmas day because the protocol doesn\\'t give you a window? Now you just have to file a protocol deviation for that and spend extra time getting a PI signature to document appropriately?\\n\\nThey are also telling me we are slow right now. If I finally feel like I have a moment to breathe there is another fire that needs to be put out, a sponsor requesting something more, or a deadline that needs to be addressed by EOB.\\n\\nI feel like I ruined my life. And after being in this sub for a few weeks I feel like this is the worst industry ever - I should have lurked here for a while before making the change. Industry prospects seem low and any future advancement seems to put me in more precarious situation. Compared to the master salary tracker I\\'m actually making a living wage in this industry compared to most, why would anyone subject themselves to this voluntarily?',\n",

The first 6 months in any new job feel bad - overwhelming, stressful, aggravating, anxiety-inducing. You\\'re learning new policies, new skills, new people, new studies, new ways of working, new routines. It will get better. Usually around 6 months things start to click faster and it starts to feel better - try to stick it out for at least that long.\\n\\nSecond, yes - there is *always* work to be done when you\\'re working in clinical research. Start prioritizing what is urgent versus what can wait - and then let those things wait. Not every email needs an immediate response. If you\\'re not sure how to break things down now into piles of \"needs to be done right away\" versus \"needs to be done this week\" versus \"can be done next week\" then ask your colleagues/mentor/whoever was training you to help, or ask your direct line manager to help you prioritize. I used to find it helpful to keep an agenda with a checklist for each day of the week - I would write out what needed to be done each day so that I\\'d know what I was doing and what I had ahead of me. It also helped me to know I wasn\\'t losing track of anything.\\n\\nYou should not be routinely working over 40 hours in a week (assuming you\\'re hired as full-time 40). Talk to your manager if you are.\\n\\nStart saving language for some of those deviations or other regulatory submissions - you\\'ll find you can reuse a lot of it with minor tweaks. Then you\\'ll be able to pop out a submission like that in 5 minutes.

The company has offered me a $25 hourly rate which I think is a bit of a pisstake.

There are some new things I would have to learn such as taking blood and learning about study coordination (a role which they want me to grow into) but all things considered I think I should be paid more.

They were very open to negotiation and asked how much I would want during the interview (I didn’t know what the time was exactly so couldn’t give them an answer) and they suggested $25 based off Seek (employment platform  where people post jobs)and the pay rate was based off a “lab tech” position. \\n\\nPlease help!!

At absolute max your resume should be 2 pages (even this is a stretch, gold standard is 1). I know many hiring managers will throw out any resume >3 pages without even reading them. Even 2 is only okay if there’s literally so much relevant experience you feel you need to include it. \\n\\nGoing through your job responsibilities you have a LOT of fluff like “prepared ad-hoc reporting for stake holders” or “managing follow ups and retention of subjects”. Those (and many, many other points) are not important enough to be their own bullet. Combine and cut it down. From how much extra I see I would say cut those down until you are down to 2 full pages at least. \\n\\nYour skills section(s) is a mess and it looks like your certifications bleed into a SECOND skills section conveniently placed over your THIRD skills section. Clearly define an area for your licenses/certifications and list them. Why is there garbage in that section like “Monday”? Rip out all of your “skills”, “additional skills”, “capabilities” etc. and consolidate it into a single list that doesn’t make the reader wish they were blind. \\n\\nHalfway through this I realized it’s more than likely a troll post because it’s genuinely that bad. But if it’s not, you need to at minimum do those changes, and there will probably be some more. \\n\\nAnd if this isn’t a troll post you need to start using PDF format so when you share it the formatting doesn’t get super messed up like what (I hope) happened here',\n",

Since the 1960s polysomnographic sleep research has demonstrated that besides disturbances of sleep continuity, depression is associated with altered sleep architecture, i.e., a decrease in slow wave sleep (SWS) production and disturbed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep regulation. Shortened REM latency (i.e., the interval between sleep onset and the occurrence of the first REM period), increased REM sleep duration and increased REM density (i.e., the frequency of rapid eye movements per REM period) have been considered as biological markers of depression which might predict relapse and recurrence. High risk studies including healthy relatives of patients with depression demonstrate that REM sleep alterations may precede the clinical expression of depression and may thus be useful in identifying subjects at high risk for the illness. Several models have been developed to explain REM sleep abnormalities in depression, like the cholinergic-aminergic imbalance model or chronobiologically inspired theories, which are reviewed in this overview. Moreover, REM sleep alterations have been recently considered not only as biological \"scars\" but as true endophenotypes of depression.”',\n",

I grew up with a loving family and was the eldest between me and my brother blah blah blah. I was raised in my life that I should dedicate my life to paying my family back for raising me. But the way I was taught growing up forced me to be a loner and loser.   \\nRules.  \\n1. I could only wear clothes and accessories approved by my family. \\n\\n2. My male friends were strictly vetted to the point where my family would even call these peoples parents and tell them not to let their kids associate. \\n\\n3. If i was found with a females number on my phone i was be strictly disciplined. (included the parents talking to not let us associate.)\\n\\nPunishments for these included not being able to enjoy hobbies, beatings, emotional abuse, and more than once I was locked in my basement. \\n\\nMy cousin that i grew up with maybe two years older then me. He continually lied on my name. Telling my parents i did something i didn't do or said something i didn't say. Leading to more of these punishments. At one point my punishment was to go to school, come home. And be locked in my room with literally nothing. Not even a paper and pen. no books. No entertainment. All because he said i disrespected him in a way i didn't do. \\n\\nAt one point i broke down leading my family to forced me to attend this religious focus group that taught me basically the same rules listed above. And i did it because maybe if i made my parents happy i could get some sort of freedom. \\n\\nAll of this led me to be the loner and loser i am today. unable to make friends. Unable to find a relationship with girls. I don't even fit into my local community. People will say out loud not to talk to me and that i'm weird or challenged or some other horrible disrespectful stuff pertaining to my race or character or upbringing. \\n\\n  \\nNow here comes my brother. Someone who didn't have to follow any of these rules. Who wasn't brought up with a shit bag cousin lying on his name. He gets whatever designer clothes he wants. Allowed to wear gold and silver (I was beaten for asking the same). Allowed to be friends with whoever he wants. Allowed to go to other females houses (something i was locked away for even asking for). Mother fucker even had sex on MY bed while both our parents were downstairs. Uk who drove him to these females houses while girls in bikinis were waiting outside for him. Me. Uk what would happen if i refused? This emotionally manipulative bullshit that i owe my family for raising me. Raising me how? To be a fucking loser? To not let me enjoy the life he was given the freedom to have. \\n\\nMy ex that i have fought tooth and nail to be with left me not to long ago and ill explain why. My parents didnt like her and at times disrespected her. They told both of us if we got married to never speak to them again. My little brother was allowed to go to whore after whores house with me as his personal driver but i finally find someone special to me that's my treatment? Yea i could've been better to at times. But i was never taught how to love or interact properly. Even she said it to me before it ended. \\n\\nI dont plan to hurt myself in anyway. But i want to carve my heart out. i explained all this to my family before but all they say is stop saying this its in the past, while i watch my younger sibling do everything i wanted to do. If or when i do decide enough is enough. i want them to read this over my corpse. I dont have enough money to be able to leave. If i did and i didnt have to pay my parents for raising me along with school bills and whatnot i would have left a long time ago. But im also scared to leave. Even if im treated poorly its better then being alone. With my skills i wouldn't even make new friends. id be alone in my apartment anyway. \\n\\n  \\nSorry about all the grammar and spelling mistakes im tired. I just needed to write this so i can have some peace of mind to sleep. Start again tomorrow driving my sibling back and forth to wear he wants to go and playing video games by myself. Drinking myself into another coma. Oh if anyone plays bo6 my in-game name is the same as my reddit user and I'm really bad. \",\n",

I was also feeling very depressed and suicidal. I almost called an ambulance but was able to make it to the hospital on my own. My dr switched my medication and today the same thing happened. I had to stop working because I felt the same symptoms and started dry heaving until I took a sip of water and threw up. I checked my bp using the machine in the break room and it was 142/81 and my heart rate was 112, so I left and went to urgent treatment. \\n\\nNow I’m contemplating on if I should go to psychiatric in patient or not. I’m to the point where I’m terrified of taking another new antidepressant. I also can’t keep leaving work early because of a reaction to my medication. Personally I would like to take an fmla leave until I can get my medication figured out, however I’m not qualified because I haven’t been at my current job for 12 months. I feel like going in patient would be good because they could try different medications and I’d be somewhere safe if something were to happen again. It’s also an excused absence from work. However, I feel like mentally I’m just not at a point where I feel like I’m a threat to myself or others. Most of the time I feel fine (still depressed but overall fine) mentally, but it’s when I’m having severe reactions to my medication that I feel like I want to die. \\n\\nIf anyone could help point me in the right direction, I would be very appreciative.

I couldn’t tell you what month of lockdown things started, but I do know that before lockdown I never missed a single college class, I was getting things done early, working on fun projects, and volunteering.

I was homeschooled, I was stuck in my own prison.. social services never helped me when I called. I grew up in my early teens thinking the system failed me, my savior was never coming..

On my nightly walks, I’ll sometimes find someone alone crying, I feel for them. I’ll sit down and ask them “what’s going on?” We’ll end up talking, they’ll cheer up and thank me for my advice, smile and walk off. Was I only put on this world to help those like me? To be the savior in someone else’s time of need.. yet, to forever be stuck without help ever coming?.. \\n\\nI jumped in front of a train once, I survived with a scar on my chest. The doctors told me “you survived suicide, it was a miracle. You survived something that should’ve killed you. You were meant for something bigger. It’s not your time yet.” Is this god playing a joke on me? To see me suffer but not let me fall into my eternal slumber?.. why?.. why me?.. if there is a god, I ask you.. why?.. what did that 6 year old boy ever do to get hurt this bad?.. what did that 6 year old boy do to not be loved?.. why god?.. what did I do that was so sinful I received this torment? Why don’t you let me fall into my slumber? Why did you choose me to receive all of your pain.. it’s been 20 years of fighting.. I’m getting tired god.. my body is wearing out god.. the scars on my body aren’t healing anymore god.. why did you let the world break my spirit this much?.. what was the point of it all? Maybe there was never any point to it and there truly isn’t a god.. and I just got unlucky.\\n\\nWhen you grow up abused as a child, not loved by a single soul not even those you’re related to.. you start to feel like the lowest hanging fruit on the tree. Do I deserve love? Do I deserve happiness? My smile is starting to wear out, it’s breaking. \\n\\nOne day, a new star will appear in the night sky.. and I’ll shine brighter than any other that fateful night.. and finally, show the world the light it greatly dimmed so long ago. \\n',\n",

At least everyone I’ve interacted with. \\n\\nI have tried for years to rewire my brain because people say it’s me who is really that way and that I’m projecting. But I don’t lie to people. I am very honest in my feelings with people, and if I don’t like someone, I choose not to be around them. I don’t do it to everyone because I like a lot of people and want certain people in my life. So I know I’m not the one who’s closed off or lying to people. I’m very open. And I try to be as nice as I can. Even when I’m mad, I stay calm and reasonable and reassuring. I’ve been told by multiple people they could learn a thing or two from me about emotional stability (I am mentally ill but I know how to control my actions and response to others). \\n\\nWhat am I supposed to do? I’m so alone. I don’t FEEL alone, I am alone. People say I can always come to them when I need someone but when I do, they either argue, roll their eyes, or give half assed responses only for me to find out they were waiting for me to just leave them alone. I am so tired of living this way, knowing just how many people are faking their way through my life. Even my own mother rolls her eyes at me simply for saying I’m depressed. She has mental illnesses herself, including depression, so she knows how it is. So I don’t understand how she could have such a response. She even told me I was killing her grand babies because I had a miscarriage. That’s a whole other issue I’m having, but my point still stands. \\n\\nI swear I must have a face people don’t like. I could talk about how I was a victim at the hands of an abuser and people will try to excuse the abuser, regardless of how bad their actions were. I genuinely don’t understand what’s wrong with me. Why am I so different from everyone even tho I’m the same as everyone else? Why is everything I do wrong, even when I’m not actually doing anything wrong, or anything at all? \\n\\nIt’s not the people I surround myself with because I meet new people and they treat me the same as everyone always has. So I try a different crowd, and they do the same thing. And again, and again, and again, and again. I always stick to groups who share interests or opinions with me. I never try to be someone I’m not or make friends with people who are not like me. One time I did try that, and those people weren’t any different than anybody else when it came to being fake toward me. It’s like everybody is scared of hurting my feelings, but no one will tell me why. Or if they do, it doesn’t make any sense. They tell me they can tell I’m a liar but that makes me so mad because I’m one of the most honest people anybody will ever meet, when they’re the ones that I caught lying. I don’t understand. Why me? What have I done? What am I supposed to do? \\n\\nThis is affecting every aspect of my life. It doesn’t just affect my interpersonal relationships. This affects my ability to get jobs. It affects my ability to find a stable place to live. It affects my ability to buy a vehicle. It affects my ability to keep hours at work when I DO finally get a job. I just don’t get it. I’ve never met anybody who shares the EXACT experience I’m having. They all say they’re going through the same thing but then they talk about all their close friends who are truly there for them, or they’re stable in one way or another, whether it be financially or the roof over their head, or even their intimate relationships. Every single part of my life has fallen apart. I say that as if it was ever together. I’ve been an outcast since I was a child when I first started going to school. I’m 23 now and nothing has changed, only now I’m an adult that’s absolutely fucked because of this type of treatment. ',\n",

       "    'selftext': \"Since the end of August, after coming from a summer holiday, my mom has been depressed and experiencing panic attacks and severe depression. The depression is not new - she has been under treatment for around 8 years with Escitalopram and Alprazolam.\\n\\nFor the past year she has been taking care of my 2-3 year old niece, spending 8-9 hours each working day at my sisters house. This was enjoyable and gave her purpose.\\n\\nIn April this year, she decided not to take her meds anymore in secret as she wanted to make sure she is present with her granddaughter (this is my reasoning). \\n\\nStopping the medication was a bad idea and the depression came back, but now with panic attacks and anxiety so she went back on Escitalopram and Alprazolam for about 6 weeks, before she was switched to Venlafaxine 37.5mg, Aripiprazole and Alprazolam. Still she would never go out and would have severe panic attacks before going to the doctor or going outside. She was however talking, she was interested in what the doctor was saying and she was generally more present.\\n\\nAfter going up to 75mg Venlafaxine for 2 weeks she had increased anxiety and panic episodes, so she tried Duloxetine, which gave her stomach aches, dizziness, nauseousness and in general made her feel bad with less intense, but constant anxiety.\\n\\nNow she has been back on Venlafaxine 37.5mg, but is not feeling better and keeps questioning when she will feel better, if ever. She does not want to leave the house and does nothing except worry all day. No TV, no reading, nothing to get her mind of things. She sleeps or lies down and waits for the next doses of medicine, although they don't really improve, just numb her.\\n\\nI don't live with my parents, but my dad is with her all day and I talk to them twice a day and visit as often as possible. Mom has always been a worrier, and one of her main concerns is not to worry the people around her. The doctor she has now is very communicative and I am in contact with her almost daily to give her details on how my mom feels. The problem is my mom gets anxious even about telling the doctor how she is doing so she tells me half truths or waits a few days to tell me how she really feels. She often misremembers or leaves out information (like the fact that her panic attacks are getting worse).\\n\\nI am stuck between giving the doctor false information and not upsetting my mom too much by constantly asking and insisting to get as much information as possible. \\n\\nShe seems a bit hopeless and is waiting for the drugs to make her feel better before she can resume any activity in her life that previously brought her joy. She does not really trust the doctor, but does not want to change her either. She is mainly afraid that whatever she tells the doctor will mean changes in her medication and prolong the process. She does not like to talk about herself and dislikes that the doctor asks her how they should proceed.\\n\\nWhat do I do? Do I move in with my parents(although this worries her more) or push to change the doctor? Do I push to have patience and continue Venlafaxine?  \\nI want to drop everything and help as much as possible, but I don't know what's the right thing to do.\",\n",

In hindsight, avoiding treatment for as long as I did (I didn't even get an official diagnosis until I was 21) may have been a mistake. Sure, I was afraid of what the pills would do to my adolescent brain, but could it have been any worse than what the host of mental illnesses that lurk inside of me did? Now I'm 29 (essentially 30) and living a life that quite literally no one would ever want. \\n\\nI don't feel...alive. I feel stupid, but I never was all that bright. It bothers me, since I always wanted to be smart, since I always had the interests and maybe even appearance of a smart person, but I was always like that. I tricked some people into thinking I was smart when I was in my 20s, but that was it. I just wish that I had been smart enough not to internalize all of the praise I got. \\n\\nBut it's not just that I feel stupid (although I do feel even dumber and more forgetful than usual). I can't quite put it into words, but it feels like my brain is doing the bare minimum it can do to function without falling into complete insentience. I can't focus, I can't have fun, I can't get work done (just chores, though, since I'm unemployed), I can't articulate my thoughts like I'd like to...I feel like that poorly understood thing that makes someone a conscious *person*, with interests and personality, is dead inside me. Like my brain is really is just a machine, something that can tell the rest of my body to go through the motions but isn't able to do anything that involves higher thought than that. I am glad that I have a therapy appointment in a couple of days, but I don't know if it's going to do anything. Maybe I need a new therapist. Maybe it's time to give up on therapy altogether and move into an institution for a while.\",\n",

But nothing changed—just endless hours of watching TV, which only fuels his unhappiness.\\n\\nRecently, he visited his daughter in a larger city for a weekend, and he came back overjoyed about how \"amazing\" it was compared to what he views as a “boring” city here. His comments made me feel terrible, as though I’m somehow responsible for his boredom. I tried speaking with his daughter about potentially having him stay with her part-time, but she avoided the topic. When she did take him for that weekend, she dropped him back off much earlier than agreed. He also has two other sons, one of whom doesn’t speak to him, while the other has been promising to take him in for years, though it’s always been an empty promise.\\n\\nAdding to the strain, my mom recently confided in me that she\\'s extremely unhappy and wants to end the relationship. However, she feels trapped because breaking up could hurt her relationship with her own mother, which she fears would affect her inheritance. She feels she has no choice but to stay, as they have no income otherwise.\\n\\nI’m at a complete loss and feeling increasingly depressed. Moving isn’t an option, as I need to stay in the area for work and my daughter’s school. I can’t just ask them to leave, as they have nowhere else to go.

       "    'selftext': 'They say the best way to get help is to ask for help yet knowing I just don’t. I left school in 2021 not going to uni thinking I could find a Level 6 degree apprenticeship as my school promoted as the best next step other than uni not knowing how famously hard it is to get into one as it is pretty much a company’s investment in your talent and wether you can deliver to there expectation. This led to sever over confidence as I thought I had it all with grade meeting their boundaries but what fucked me over was the experience.\\n\\nNever even getting a job, they want you to participate in countless experience programs in and out of school which includes volunteering which, as a kid, didn’t want to do as I was lazy or couldn’t as it was mainly reserved for the higher achieving student. I was never a failing student but did improve overall in collage(High school) so I assumed my life would continue without much hassle from higher education. The reasons why I never considered going to university was the student debt. I have heard from too many people their horror story form them not finding anything after and their qualifications being almost worthless as they would be working jobs that do not require your degree so I was put off however when I heard level 6 degree apprenticeship, it literally had everything I could of wanted. Payed off uni check. Work experience check. Almost guaranteed job after completing the apprenticeship check. And finally payed while working check check check. \\n\\nI wish my teacher just told me that the ultra high achieving students with experience would get this and just to clarify why my school didn’t have any work experience, it because of COVID. I was blind no one to guide me or ask where was my next steps and how to get there not even my parents but I will not blame those saints in human clothing as they tolerate me now.\\n\\nWhen I applied to multiple apprenticeships during 2019/2020 so I discarded the thought of going to uni but one of my teacher pushed me to apply so I did and got in my first choice but chosen not to for the prospect the apprenticeship and during that period at home due to Covid I was care free as I dreamt of going places and helping my family but surprise surprise, didn’t even get a rejection email not once which shocked me heavily as coming to September I had nothing to do which was a first but luckily my collage had a HNC program for a year and also helped in doing more degree programs to further help in your CV so I took the chance.\\n\\nThis is the point where I knew I was a grade 1 idiot. During the extra year, my collage had connections to a University and said once we complete the year you can apply to the uni to go straight to the second year or first year if you choose but like the fucking idiot I was I was still hopeful for the apprenticeship so I continued applying and just living on and again all program was again all canceled due to COVID restrictions. Low and fucking behold, I never got in. This is where it kick in. I was home with nothing to actually do except to find a job but that didn’t even cross my mind so I kept applying to even level 4 and level 3 apprenticeship thing I will start form the bottom and work my way up but never did I once get to the interview stage. NOT FUCKING ONCE. And to remain you that HNC was a first year university degree so equivalent to Level 5 apprenticeship so I kept fucking assuming that I would get in and do something but no that never came.\\n\\nThis all stems from your CV. How does your CV looks like to the people your applying to which apparently they barely look at. So what’s the next steps. Are your parent well connected. Well not really as they  are immigrants who are working 0 hour contracts and basically weekly scraps which I never realized until I was out of school and helping them at home(I was stupid in my surroundings). I generally thought I was living decent life until I saw our expenses and the year by year increase prices and tax in pretty much everything. I had nothing.\\n\\n2022 comes I started to apply less and less, not doing much except help my family by cooking and cleaning pretty much every day. I became more unhealthy day by day, my body becoming a mess with the lack of walking I did and did not have the stamina that I had when I did a lot of activity and sports during collage.\\n\\nEvery day I was I tears and angry at me and everything in private, became worse at controlling my emotions and stared to isolate my self constantly to the point I was barely eating and having weird thoughts but I was strangely aware. I know how I was feeling but didn’t care enough. When it bothers me too much I over stimulated with video and games to ignore and forget to the point I was too good at it. I cook, then clean then lie and do nothing or play games . During this period, my parents and my older sister was telling me to find a job at least which I would say that I would but never deliver because I was at the assumption that I was going to get rejected all over again so never bothered.\\n\\nI’m numb. Heavily numb to the point of financial crisis and I barely care. What’s funny is that one day I applied to an Amazon warehouse job and they called me to come in. I was more alive at that day for the first time in forever. For 2 weeks the made us do basic maths and English check and a background test and explains what the job was which was simple and then led to the interview. Excited, I dress in a suit which was rotting in my wardrobe and went to the interview which wasn’t as I expected. The interview was nice and was asking simple questions like where was my last working place and what time was I available so I believe it went smoothly and went home happy promising my family that I’ll change for the better. I was rejected for lack of experience. Fucking experience. Hot job in question I applied didn’t ask for experience. It was just a fucking warehouse job and I was willing to work hard for it but it never came. You can guess what happens next. Became more numb and pulled a fake happy face to my family and acted as it was a set back and I could try again. It is when I realized I could take rejection properly. It’s not that I was spoiled it’s the opposite, I just did what I was told and never expected more. Didn’t go out after school when I was young because I was never allowed and had to look after my younger siblings so my friends never bothered me to ask me out. Didn’t really challenge it so I became antisocial but only when school time ends. I have a lot more issue that just never got treated or helped so I became someone I wasn’t really. What ever was cool, researched went along with whether it was music, social talking points that was happening in the area or viral thing even if I didn’t like it. This also include if I was the but of the joke or harassment so I laughed at it just so they wouldn’t care anymore because I saw how it went when I played into their harassment but getting upset, they love it as I was quite easy to pick on in my younger years of secondary school(Middle School).\\n\\nI’m quite the fake person to my friends and my family really as I joke and play on the daily as if I didn’t I would generally be a bitter and terrible person and I know it. Became shut off to the point that I stop talking to good friends and never checking with them because I made our friendship just a school thing and that only.\\n\\nThis became quite long honestly and through writing this I never knew I had so much to say which I have more but let’s save it for never I guess. Never did drugs, don’t drink or smoke(Mainly because I cannot afford it but still wouldn’t have done because I despise it), outside of this it seems that I’m ok but really the devil is really yourself and procrastinating. I hate and love myself in a twist of fate. It may be due to being aware but have no motivation. I’m happy for everyone who succeeds in what they like and I hope you find what you enjoy and truly aim for it as only you can get what you want but you have to find it unlike me.\\n\\nGod knows if I even post this but if I do I guess I really do need help.\\n\\nI’m British btw :)',\n",

       "    'selftext': 'I’ve been trying to do something about how I feel but none of the things I’ve tried worked out. I joined the gym to try to do something about my weight which is too high. I weigh 13 stone and I’m 5 foot 6 (too short as well) and even though nobody believes me I’m clinically obese. To be healthy I need to lose basically half my body weight. I signed up under the assumption one of my friends at the time would go with me to make me feel more comfortable, but that ended up not materialising. I can’t stand the idea of people seeing me at the gym and I knew that it wouldn’t work when I went for my gym induction and saw all of the good looking people there. Knowing that even if I was slim I’d still look ugly didn’t help. I’ve cut down to two meals per day and I don’t eat sugar anymore (processed, I still eat fruit), and I plan to cut down to one meal per day in the near future. Still, I only lost two or three pounds with this so I need to do something to get my weight down.\\n\\nOver the past few months I’ve lost pretty much all my friends. Everyone I was friends with who lived near me abandoning me because they think I’m a lost cause and a weirdo, and the two friends I have left live far away. One of them lives four hours away on the train, and the other lives in Spain (I’m in the UK). I’ve started volunteering to meet new people but I don’t want to drive any of them away like I did with pretty much everyone else I’ve thought of as a friend. Currently the only thing that I’m looking forward to in life is getting money. I’m lucky in that regard, but I promise that the money won’t make you happy if you think it will.\\n\\nI tried antidepressants but that didn’t go well either. I was prescribed fluoxetine and had a major allergic reaction to it which meant I couldn’t walk for several days and had an awful rash on my face and hands. My doctor was quite dismissive about it but prescribed me on a different antidepressant which I have yet to take as I’m scared that I’ll have bad side effects or another allergic reaction. I’ve been in counselling for about half of my life and myself and my family have spent thousands on it, but I have only got worse over that period.\\n\\nI’ve pretty much given up in other aspects of my life. I tried multiple dating apps and got absolutely nothing (despite people telling me that I’m attractive, which is the sort of white lie that is completely obvious), and nobody I’ve ever asked on a date has been interested. I don’t see much point in trying to have a normal relationship now, so now my focus is using the money I’m getting to start a business. I can be lonely, but at least I’ll (hopefully) have money. Not much consolation, but I don’t have much else.\\n\\nSomeone please give me a good reason to try, because I ‘m really struggling to see one.',\n",

I want the people who know me to know I appreciate them and it wouldn\\'t be their fault. I wonder if there\\'s anyone who would be mad at being left out. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure why, but writing it was hard and gave me a sense of peace afterwards. Like if I die now, nothings going unsaid. \\n\\nThough I wonder if anyone\\'s getting weirded out by it, yknow? Like what if someone you didn\\'t even like died and their suicide note said they thought you were close friends. That\\'d be stupid I guess, but it wouldn\\'t be my problem anymore. Most people tend to forgive minor social transgressions when you\\'re dead and i don\\'t think I\\'ve done anything bad enough that the resentment would carry past my death, but I do think the average reaction would be apathy. \\n\\nI wish I had a dead man\\'s switch tbh. Like if I die it\\'s sent out automatically, just in case I get shot or hit by a car or something. It\\'d suck ass if I died some other way and my final words were wasted. I guess one benefit of killing myself is that it won\\'t surprise me. \\n\\nI kind of wish I could get a terminal disease or something, know I have 2 months to live so I can quit working and just kind of settle my affairs and go. Then people would get to say their goodbyes to me too, if they\\'ve got any, and they wouldn\\'t be flipping out about convincing me not to die. \\n\\nI honestly am SO curious how people would react to my death. I know three people would be sad. I don\\'t think my crush would be all too pressed about it. One of the things that prevents me from doing it is something a close friend wrote on the ten year anniversary of her girlfriends suicide,  \"I wonder every day what you would\\'ve grown to be\", and how much that suicide hurt her. But that was her girlfriend, I\\'m not nearly as important to her or to anyone else.\\n\\n I am curious what the future holds, but if the last... eight? Years are anything to go by, it\\'s not anything better. My circumstances certainly change but the daily pain and grief sure don\\'t, and the root cause is something I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever change. My life is a cycle and each time the same fucking problems hit me again, it hurts more than last time. I wake up and think about everything that\\'s happened to me lately and realize that if this is life, I don\\'t want anymore of it. But I dunno. I haven\\'t actually tried to kill myself before and I don\\'t think I will. I\\'m kind of a coward for that, I suppose. Too afraid to do it myself so I just make my preparations and hope something else does it for me, how pathetic is that?\\n\\nI\\'ve pondered a lot of silly things regarding my own demise. How would I give away all my stuff in the least suspicious way possible, for one. Like if I quit magic it\\'d make sense to sell my cards, why would I just give them all to someone? My friends know I\\'m financially struggling so I don\\'t think they\\'d buy me just not giving a shit about the money, and it\\'s a collection worth at least 4 digits. \\n\\nSame with like, my ps5. Weird thing to just give someone. My going excuse is \"I won a raffle for a ps5 pro so you can have my normal one\", no idea if that\\'s any good lol. I don\\'t think anyone would read into it much lmao, I gotta remind myself people don\\'t care about what I say most of the time. Most of these fuckers didn\\'t even answer when I invited them to come over on my birthday. Thirty one people invited, only two people even answered to tell me no. I went to all their events, when invited, but every relationship in my life has been all one sided so I\\'m not surprised in the least. \\n\\nHonestly one of the biggest things that keeps me from doing it is that I can still be useful to other people if I\\'m alive. My physically disabled friend relies on me every now and then, but I have made clear to them if they ever need anything I\\'m there. I don\\'t want to inconvenience them by dying, but I know I\\'m their last choice. The last time we went to an event together they asked if anyone could push them in their wheelchair, and when I said I could, they asked if anyone else could do it and went with my friend who they\\'d never even met before lol. Like am I just shit at it or do I have a rancid aura or what.\\n\\nThey\\'ll be fine without me I\\'m sure. They were fine before me. I volunteer at a soup kitchen every now and again, but I know they don\\'t need me either. Me volunteering doesn\\'t even really help solve that problem, it\\'s definitely giving a man a fish so he can eat for a day, metaphorically speaking, if the rest of the metaphor pertained to solving the systemic societal issues behind homelessness instead of teaching the guy to fish.  I\\'d honestly be doing way more for the homeless by getting involved in local politics but I\\'m too much of a wastoid for that. \\n\\nLike, I\\'m willing to drop anything to do anything for people I\\'m even slightly familiar with and this has been cashed in maybe twice ever. Why do people just not want me to help them, I don\\'t exactly ask for anything in return. I\\'m literally so annoying I\\'m not even worth a selfish person pretending to like me for free labor lol. \\n\\nMaybe people feel too bad to ask me for help because I\\'m also physically disabled. I guess there\\'s a lot I literally can\\'t do no matter how badly I want to. I\\'m kinda whatever about it, I hope that\\'s not what\\'s stopping them of all things. \\n\\nI wonder how it\\'d go at work without me. I\\'m on a two person team and the other person splits responsibilities between my site and another site. Would they just shut down the entire site without me? It doesn\\'t exactly generate good results so I don\\'t think I\\'m worth replacing, but maybe they\\'d do it anyways, I can\\'t tell how my bosses think eighty percent of the time. \\n\\nI also wonder how much people expect it. Do I come across as depressed as I am? Probably not, I usually mask it around others, but I dunno if they can tell from how desperate I am for company. Again they probably don\\'t read into it much. It\\'s a shame I\\'m so invested in what other people think about me when the truth is that they don\\'t at all, lol. But again I\\'m used to one sided consideration anyways so it\\'s business as usual.\\n\\nNot sure how to end this. Was kind of stream of consciousness talking. Can\\'t say this to a professional without getting institutionalized and then I\\'m turbo fucked, if I get fired I am DEFINITELY killing myself because I\\'d lose my insurance paying for my hrt, as well as becoming homeless and shit. Oh well. Hope that doesn\\'t happen. ',\n",

       "    'selftext': \"For some background, around a year ago I suffered an horrific OCD flare up (a condition I've greatly suffered from since early childhood) which was largely purely obsessional. This caused me to become severely anxious and withdraw from seeing friends. These new symptoms were in addition to the rituals I'd had all my life.  I tried Nicotine to ease the thoughts which helped somewhat at the start and evolved into further worsening of the intrusive thoughts. \\n\\nFluoxetine:\\n\\nI visited the doctor who tried Propanolol and Fluoxetine after he discovered my resting heart rate was 102bpm. The Propanolol helped slightly but after 5 weeks of treatment the Fluoxetine caused serious disassociation, panic attacks and anxiety i didn't even know was possible. \\n\\nMirtazapine (Remeron):\\n\\nA new doctor then decided to put me on Mirtazapine, which essentially wiped me out for 48 hours after taking my first dose. All was going well aside from weight loss and lethargy and my dose was eventually titrated up 15,30 then 45mg. I was on this dose for nearly a year (up until 6 weeks ago). For anxiety it worked well but it didn't put my back to my previous baseline of it being manageable, it really only changed the compulsions to cleanliness. I started getting nasty thoughts, hated everyone around me and felt no emotional connection to my newborn son. Everything my girlfriend did irritated me beyond words.\\n\\nI fantasied daily about leaving her for someone better and felt a lot of built up resentment towards her and anything she's ever done. I threw her out of the house and my newborn son for a week after an argument and felt zero remorse. I hated her and everyone around me being near me. I slept on the sofa for 7 months before I eventually wanted to end my life through sheer hopelessness. My family told me I was evil on the tablets and completely different. I'd talk with my mother daily on the phone for an hour prior to the medication and enjoyed talking to her - now I'd swear down the phone at her and ask her why she's bothering me. \\n\\nI was lethargic, slept until mid afternoon, didnt help with the baby and had no energy whatsoever. My muscles ached like I had arthritis. \\n\\nOddly enough, all of my focus issues went away that I have had all my life. I rediscovered my hobbies, enjoyed work and became work obsessed. Jobs I could never start got done and I was decently productive. This is making me push my doctors for an evaluation for ADHD. \\n\\n6 weeks ago,  the doctor agreed it wasn't normal and said I could just withdraw cold turkey which was agonising for 2 weeks. I couldn't concentrate, my business has suffered as a result and I've lost a lot of weight through lack of appetite/nausea. \\n\\nEscitaloprám (Lexapro):\\n\\nAfter agreeing I could just quit, the doctor instantly put me on Escitaloprám (Lexapro) 5mg.\\n\\nWeek 1:\\nNothing to report \\n\\nWeek 2:\\nInstant mood uplift, feel elated, more social and hypersexual (possibly result of quitting Mirtazapine?)\\n\\nWeek 3/4:\\nMuch the same as Week 2, less intense \\n\\nWeek 5/6:\\n\\nUnable to sit still and restless, girlfriend and people irritate me, no motivation to do anything, can't concentrate, major brain fog, much reduced OCD symptoms (basically in remission), total loss of sex drive, hopelessness, nausea and headaches.\\n\\nWhy do I react this way to antidepressents?

It feels like I\\'m trapped in a Groundhog Day loop. Every day\\'s the same thing, over and over again, and I\\'m not even full-time! I usually get 1-2 days a week off and those days off help but then it\\'s right back to the daily grind. Compared to my previous job, this one\\'s definitely a step up and I think I like working here better than at my old job. Even so, I feel like I\\'m gonna go insane if I have to keep doing this for the rest of my life. Every day is just work, watch anime/surf the internet/play video games, rinse and repeat. I can\\'t just quit though, I don\\'t have another job lined up and I don\\'t wanna disappoint my parents whom I still live with. I\\'m not even sure what else I\\'d do anyway, I don\\'t have the training nor experience for anything else really. There\\'s nothing else I really wanna do anyway.\\n\\nPrior to this job, I worked two days a week (though towards the end it became more like one day) at a fast food place, so this is the most I\\'ve worked in my entire life. I guess I don\\'t really have a right to complain, like I said I\\'m only part-time and work between 20-30 hours a week maybe? But if this is part-time, I\\'m scared what full-time is like! But full-time is the only way to get things like benefits and health insurance. With my old job, since I only worked 1-2 days a week the rest of the time I was just sitting at home more or less (I don\\'t have a driver\\'s license or a car) watching anime, playing games, etc. Not a very productive life, I know. I\\'d go through periods of obsession with certain anime, games, etc. where I\\'d spend almost every waking minute on them or some activity that had to do with them. That hasn\\'t really happened for awhile now though, I don\\'t think. These periods of obsession felt pretty good, got my heart pumping, made me feel alive. But when I ran out of material  to watch, play, etc. I crashed and burned and it felt like going through a withdrawal. It really felt like an addiction.\\n\\nStill, these periods also made me feel like utter garbage because I\\'d waste all my time, never doing anything  productive, but it was like an addiction and it was hard to stop. And the rest of the time, when I wasn\\'t going through these periods of intense obsession, I just kinda felt meh, like I had no motivation. I don\\'t really have any friends anymore, the friends I used to have in high school have all kinda drifted apart. The one friend I used to see and hang out with in-person weekly moved a little over a year ago. We still chat online but it\\'s not the same. I\\'d probably feel better if I had some friends, but I don\\'t even know how to begin to go about doing that. Especially when I live in the suburbs with no real form of transportation and crippling social anxiety.\\n\\nLately I\\'ve just been feeling really down and anxious, having trouble with panic attacks even with my current psychiatric medication. I\\'m terrified I\\'ll never feel \"alive\" or truly happy or excited about anything again. I still get some pleasure from things like watching anime and eating food I like, but not that \"omg this is amazing, I\\'m so excited!\" type of joy.

A year ago I was assessed as having \"high functioning\" Autism via my Therapist but I am on a wait list for a formal diagnosis. I\\'ve been working on self-acceptance alot and been finding ways to cope with life alot better since this preliminary diagnosis. I\\'ve been on several medications for difforent reasons but my current regiment that has worked for me up to this point is a high dose of Zoloft with Mirtazopine(Remeron). \\n\\nCurrent situation:\\nStarting this summer though I fell into a depression that I just havnt been able to shake off until a couple weeks ago.

       "    'selftext': \"I'm a woman in my 20's. I had cystic acne on my face throughout my teenages. I was on tretinoin for 8 months when I was 18 and continued to form new scars during and after treatment. I've had depression and anxiety since my mom died when I was 18. One of the biggest factors that has contributed to my poor mental health and has literally ruined my whole life for me are my acne scars.\\n\\nI am from Pakistan and where I come from, most marriages are arranged by the family where the boy's family visits the girl's house to see her and thereafter they either send a marriage proposal or simply inform them that they have rejected the girl. Looks are a huge part of whether she's going to be chosen. I don't want anyone to look at my face up close. At first I was only conscious about boys noticing the scars but for a few years I am ashamed of even my friends and family looking at them and I have not been meeting them for a long time. Where I come from, acne scar treatment is quite cheaper compared to the West, whether it's laser or fat grafting. Many years back I visited a cosmetic surgeon with my father. He looked at my scars and said this could be fixed with fat grafting. He said it would cost Rs. 100,000 (Pakistani currency) which is around $360 today but was around a $1000 back then. Even laser sessions in Pak are very cheap, like $50 per session. But my father refused to pay for my treatment at that time even though he is the one who has always pressurized me to get married and to let him arrange my marriage to a boy of his choosing. But at the end of the day it's on me for the boy and his family to 'like' me and my appearance for that to happen. He spends lavishly on his new wife (stay at home mom) and kids, way more than he can afford, travelling to other countries and what not and but could not spend so little on my treatment. \\n\\nI hate my face. It it makes me so angry that this is something that could have been fixed a long, long time ago if my father wanted but he chose not to fix it. I dont leave the house. It's so unfair. My father blames me for not getting married on time cuz most girls over here get married in their early 20's. He abused us financially after my mom's death not because he was not well to do but simply because he chose to. My siblings and my basic needs were neglected to pay for the luxurious lifestyle of my stepmother and their kids. Every time I look in the mirror, it just reminds me that my own father abandoned me, neglected me, let me remain scarred and not good enough for any boy to like.\\n\\nI feel so helpless. I know these treatments are quite expensive all around the world. And I feel so unfortunate that I was unable to get these treatments despite them being so inexpensive in my country compared to others, All I wish for is for my scars to disappear. I want to hang out with friends. I want to go on dates. I want to work. I'm suffering from extreme executive dysfunction. I wish I could earn. I have ADHD (self-diagnosed). I wish I could get my ADHD treated, so I could work and earn and get my scars treated myself but the past few years I have lived in such misery, I don't like to look at myself in the mirror. I don't want anything in my life more than I want to get my scars treated. I'm crying as I am writing this because I never talk about it to anyone. This is the first time I'm talking about it. I can't deal with it any longer.\",\n",

       "    'selftext': 'I’m a piece of human garbage and I recognize and accept that I’ll be dealing with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life.\\n\\nThis winter and spring I dealt with a significant mental health crisis. It started as depression that I opted to treat with therapy. My therapist recommended meds. Well one med turned into probably 5 or 6 after one wasn’t working. The result of this was something I can’t even describe. I was entirely not myself for months until I stopped all meds and assumably they got out of my system. I opted for ketamine treatment instead, my depression resolved and I was back with my head on the ground as if I had just stepped out of a movie being someone I wasn’t for months.\\n\\nDuring this time I made absolutely awful decisions that literally ruined my life. What started as one night out of the house for a break turned into me staying with a friend and then getting a new apartment leaving my wife and son for the time but still coming to see him and spend time with him. My relationship prior to this was on and off rocky, and during this time I had asked my wife about working on things going to therapy together etc and she could never tell me yes. Eventually she said she wanted a divorce and that’s when I thought I needed to move on too. But things still seemed ambiguous from time to time and I never knew what was happening. After she said she wanted a divorce I talked to a girl for a short time, we basically dated because I thought at the time in the mindset I was in that I had to try and move on.\\n\\nThe worst of it all was one night after I moved out and after she had told me she didn’t want to get back together I told my sister that my wife hit me when I was at the house. That didn’t happen. And honestly I am so f-ing disgusted with myself, I do not know what was wrong with me or what all these meds did to me but I truly was not me during this time. I don’t even know why I said that.\\n\\n\\nWe are honestly pretty amicable together day to day. But there isn’t a day that goes by where I’m not reminded of what I’ve done. And that’s her right. I understand I hurt her very badly. But I don’t know what else she wants from me at this point. I’ve apologized profusely. I put on Facebook for everyone to see at her request that I basically destroyed my family. My sisters no longer talk to me. All I have left is my dad who won’t ever stop loving me but he won’t be around forever. She has a front row seat to the aftermath of me single-handedly destroying my life and I don’t think I’ll ever forgive myself. But I can’t live like this forever either.\\n\\nShe knows that what happened during that time was not me. Not even close. Never in 11 years had I ever acted anywhere even remotely close to that. Those meds had me seriously screwed up and although it’s not an excuse necessarily it’s certainly a reason for the inexcusable behavior and I know that was not me.\\n\\nhow do I move on from this and forgive myself? Should I even? Because I feel like the biggest piece of human garbage. No one will ever hate me as much as I hate me. I don’t even feel like I deserve to hold the title of father to my son honestly. Most days I wish I didn’t wake up. I’m not going to do anything but I wouldn’t be upset if something happened either. I don’t deserve shit in this life.',\n",

This relentless pursuit, however, came at a great cost. Over time, I began to experience severe cognitive impairments that have persisted to this day.\\n\\nMy symptoms are profound and affect every aspect of my life:\\n- **Memory Loss:** I struggle with basic memory functions. For example, I can go to the bathroom to fetch something and completely forget what I was doing by the time I leave.\\n- **Comprehension Issues:** Processing new information has become increasingly difficult, making normal conversations and tasks challenging.\\n- **Physical Symptoms:** I frequently experience heart palpitations that feel akin to the onset of a panic attack.\\n- **Mental Episodes:** There are moments where I feel as if I am dreaming even though I am awake, which are both confusing and frightening.\\n\\nSocially, these issues have led to misunderstandings and I’ve felt isolated as people perceive me differently. Despite numerous medical checks (like thyroid tests, which came back normal) and experimenting with various treatments such as meditation, nootropics, peptides, and more, nothing has significantly alleviated my condition.\\n\\nI am desperate for any guidance on potential diagnoses that might explain my symptoms, or stories from those who have recovered from similar experiences. I’m open to both conventional medical treatments and alternative therapies. Any advice on improving my cognitive functions and managing the psychological impact of this condition would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read my story.

I'm extremely empathetic but so far I have managed to keep work and volunteering separate from my personal life. \\n\\nExcept I do have this friend, a close friend, who is very reliant on me. He's got complex special needs and this causes him to act erratic, sometimes on top of the world with all these ideas about who he's going to be but then he crashes, and becomes very depressive very easily. Both when he's 'manic' and when he's depressed, it drains my energy. I know that sounds awful, and I don't mean it to. Friendships are for better or for worse, but I've found lately, with one crisis after another at work, then with all the other things I do, that I'm so exhausted and can't provide the emotional support to my friends and family that I once could. \\n\\nI don't think I am doing to badly, balancing my life, but I don't think it'll last long if I have to go from 50+ hours a week being involved in mental health conversations, crises, research, reports etc to then spending more time trying to uplift others in my personal life. It's not sustainable. \\n\\nFor now, I will have to make do. But if this is the case, I need some tips. What do you guys do to protect your mental health?

I decided to return to my hometown since I could not find a job in the city where my college was situated.

After about 7 months of staying at home, I feel like I have fallen behind, wasting all the progress that I made after getting therapy. I rarely step out of my home, waking up to work and then going back to my bed. I feel more anxious when put in social situations- for example, I recently signed up to volunteer at a lit fest. We had a pre-event meeting where they were explaining the roles- I felt incredibly nervous throughout. Even a trip to the hairdressers wrecked my nerves \\n\\nAdditionally, I feel insanely numb now. It has been some time since I had a good cry, even though I have all the intense emotions in my head. I have been telling myself that what I do is a waste of time, rethinking if I did make the right decision in choosing things for myself.

I’m a survivor from sexual abuse because I was abused by my grandpa multiple times in my childhood. I grew up in an abusive family and failed in my studies. A few years I had a very abusive relationship where I was sexually abused by my ex who also suffered severe mental health issues. The relationship with her was the lowest point in my life. \\nI recovered, went to therapy, took my meds and changed completely my life starting over from blank. Now I enjoy a stable life, I have a good payed job, a nice car and a beautiful home in an amazing rural place. I volunteer as EMT and play in an amateur orchestra. I have a loving girlfriend and I have quite some money to invest in my future. Things are going well - which is a real f***ing miracle considering the premises. \\nStill I sometimes feel this terrible urge to let go of everything and go live as a complete anonymous persone in another country - just to disappear suddenly because I don’t deserve what I have. I still haven’t finished my studies and feel like a complete failure. My parents are still very toxic to me and constantly demand money from me. And I sometimes think what if I leave everything behind, kill myself or go live in another continent, in the last months I felt this urge stronger and stronger. \\n ',\n",

       "    'selftext': \"Hello friends!\\n\\nIt's that time of the year again. We have always intended for\\xa0r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.\\n\\nPolitical anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:\\n\\n**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.\\n\\n**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:\\n\\n[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)\\n\\n[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)\\n\\n[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)\\n\\n**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.\\n\\n**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.\\n\\n**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. We have a**\\xa0[list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/)\\xa0**on our sidebar as well as a link to a**\\xa0[global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)\\xa0**of emergency numbers.**\\n\\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions feel free to make a comment in this thread, or\\xa0[send us a modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2Fmentalhealth)\\n\\nStay safe out there!\",\n",

Saying \"cardio isn\\'t a good way to lose weight\" is fundamentally wrong, it is the single-most effective way to burn the most calories in the shortest time. It is correct that if you do too much cardio you may lose significant muscle mass. But if your arthritis is caused by excessive weight, it will not matter if the weight lost is fat or muscle - because it would be about the same amount of weight lost. Strength training burns very little calories. The addition of muscle mass does burn additional calories at rest, but something like 1 pound of muscle burns only an additional 6 calories per day. Not significant enough. Realistically, using both strength training and cardio will render the best body composition with the benefits of weight loss, not just strength training.',\n",

Am I better and more comfortable now that I am an ideal weight and do strength training to make strong muscle support?

People eat way less on the drug (some people even report throwing up a bunch).\\n\\n\\nA really big issue is we really haven't done a great job of studying the physiological and neurological processes within food and obesity.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWe know men and women don't gain and lose weight the same way with the same ease. People who are high in testosterone prioritize muscle and performance, their body is more than happy to burn fat reserves in order to enable muscle repair after gym day. And muscle burns calories like crazy, so it means a week\\xa0 from now the same amount of calories is creating less fat reserves in the first place,because the muscle is eating it up.Women's bodies are designed to withstand famine and be ready for a potential pregnancy. So women's bodies aren't as eager to burn fat stores, and they don't build muscle as rapidly\\n\\n\\nSo men often tend to be able to drop weight very quickly and it's immediately noticable, they feel great. Women's weight loss tends to be much less of a straight line and tends to need to be done over a longer period. We also know exercise and nutritional recs from women should fluctuate with her cycle. You can make the process a lot harder than it needs to be by insisting on pretending women's physiology isn't different\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe issue is we are discovering there's very likely other variations between people between boy/girl. There are people who do appear to have a genetic predisposition to being famine ready. Just like there's people who think cilantro tastes like soap, there's people who's body seems to really really like carbs and sugars, whereas there's other people who have a fairly low ability to perceive bitterneness,which means they tend to find incorporating certain vegetables a lot easier etc.\\n\\n\\nYou can't expect universal outcomes from a varied population. If you can go all day without eating and function, n awesome good for you. If someone else needs a drug to go all day without eating .....shouldn't you be happy they're willing to withstand the side effects of the drug so they can go all day without eating?

Theres several hundreds of them, but some, like the subtypes 3A4 or 2D6 play a role in a lot of drugs. \\n\\nSome background regarding drug levels: You want a drug level in a steady state in most antidepressants and other long-term medication. This is achieved due to the fact that the drug isn\\'t completetly cleared from the system before the next dose is given, meaning it will slowly rise until eliminiation time is equivalent to the daily intake. \\n\\nNow, how does this work?  \\nTheres two options. Option one: Some drugs need to be \"activated\" by enzymes, meaning that the drug itself needs to be converted by them to be effective (These are called \"pro-drugs\"). When a cyp is overactive, a drug will be converted really fast, meaning there will be a quick effect (and side effect), but no long lasting drug level will be achieved. When the cyp is underactive, there won\\'t be enough metabolization and the pro-drug will be cleared by kidney or liver before it can achieve a proper drug level.  \\nOption two: the drug is active and the Cyps will metabolize them to become inactive. In this scenario, overactive Cyps will lead to a faster clearance and no drug level will be achieved. Underactive Cyps can be really dangerous in this scenario: since they don\\'t get metabolized, the drug will accumulate and can reach toxic levels. \\n\\nSome medications (or certain substances like grapefruit juice) can increase or decrease Cyp activity, which can lead to drug interactions. \\n\\nYour individual genetic Cyp profile can be determined and analyzed, but that can be rather complicated. Sometimes, by knowing how you have reacted to which drugs, you can assume to have a certain Cyp profile.',\n",

The biomarker thing is a big issue but even with what is known right now no effort is made. Somebody who has low self esteem thought based depression (no blunting, anhedonia) gets diagnosed the same MDD illness as someone who overnight got suicidal anhedonia from a virus. Both get told to do CBT (basically a placebo). It’s obvious who will benefit more. And then when it comes to drug trials, the person in the former category also has a higher placebo response.\\n\\nThis is pretty basic stratification but its not done. Biological depression is an entirely different entity. And the scales used in psychiatry are horrible-you can get more points reduced if you put someone to sleep and up their appetite more than if you actually make them feel more pleasure. \\n\\nAlso the antidepressants for example themselves can cause persistent anhedonia, blunting, sexual dysfunction. This was not accounted for. The problem is these side effects can be blamed on “underlying illness” even if the patient never had them before. Thus leading to gaslighting, and the reason there yea comes down to there being no objective biomarker for anhedonia.',\n",

Particularly, acupuncture displayed fewer side effects and adverse reactions, suggesting potential benefits for depression patients over four weeks as opposed to medication alone.\\n\\nChronic Pain: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658605/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658605/)\\n\\n>We found acupuncture to be superior to both no acupuncture control and sham acupuncture for the treatment of chronic pain. Although the data indicate that acupuncture is more than a placebo, the differences between true and sham acupuncture are relatively modest, suggesting that factors in addition to the specific effects of needling are important contributors to therapeutic effects.\\n\\nPlacebo acupuncture has some effectiveness, that is not to say that placebo acupuncture is not measurably different from practitioner acupuncture.\\n\\n>To give an example of what these effect sizes mean in real terms, baseline pain score on a 0 – 100 scale for a typical trial might be 60. Given a standard deviation of 25, follow-up scores might be 43 in a no acupuncture group, 35 in sham acupuncture and 30 in patients receiving true acupuncture.\\n\\nCompared to western medicine where placebo effects are similarly powerful: [source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect#:~:text=A%20study%20published%20in%20Science,ingredients%20of%20a%20placebo%20effect)\\n\\n>One group took a migraine drug labeled with the drug\\'s name, another took a placebo labeled \"placebo,\" and a third group took nothing. The researchers discovered that the placebo was 50% as effective as the real drug to reduce pain after a migraine attack.\\n\\nThe effect of placebo is similarly powerful in western and eastern medicine, as is the benefit of real vs sham treatment. From a practitioner point of view the application of the placebo is particularly problematic, in western medicine, where the placebo process was created, the placebo should have almost no bodily effect, eg a sugar pill. In acupuncture, placing a needle in a body is going to have some effect, it may not be the same calming point but your body will still experience some stimulus from the application of the placebo. Instead of the sugar pill it\\'s like giving someone a different medication entirely, which will sometimes be reported as working erroneously - \"Oh yeah, I feel different!\" [Here\\'s a good article on the problems with sham acupuncture](https://www.journal-jams.org/journal/view.html?doi=10.51507/j.jams.2022.15.6.333)\\n\\nA resource for reading more on the scientific basis of acupuncture: [https://www.evidencebasedacupuncture.org/acupuncture-scientific-evidence/](https://www.evidencebasedacupuncture.org/acupuncture-scientific-evidence/)\\n\\n>Many biochemical and signaling pathways have been identified as playing a direct role in how acupuncture achieves its clinical effects, but perhaps the most central pathway that acupuncture uses, one that helps explain how it is effective in such a diverse array of clinical areas, is that acupuncture has been demonstrated to directly initiate a process called purinergic signaling, a primitive14 and ubiquitous system in the body using adenosine and ATP for signaling and regulation in all tissues and organ systems.15 It is now understood that all nerve transmission requires ATP as a co-factor and the that the body uses purine levels as a primary background signal of both healthy function and tissue damage. Studies on mice demonstrate that those that were bred to be unable to bind to adenosine did not have pain relief from acupuncture nor any of the chemical changes associated with acupuncture pain relief, while the normal mice did16,17 and this effect was repeated in humans.18\\n\\n>Purinergic signaling has been demonstrated to play a central role in such diverse clinical areas as migraines and headaches,19 immune dysfunction and inflammation,20 cancer,21 autism,22 Alzheimer’s,23 cardiovascular disease,24,25 endocrine function,26 embryological development,27 and gastrointestinal disorders28.',\n",

If I am reading that correctly, that seems like a pretty bad confound... which is why I wonder if I misunderstand. \\n\\nAssuming I understood it correctly, I'd say there's still confounds for why the acupuncture group had an effect. \\n\\n>Location of acupoints followed the World Health Organization’s *Standard Acupuncture Locations*.[^(21)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2825064#ioi240067r21) Obligatory acupoints for the acupuncture group were bilateral *dachangshu* (BL25) and *guanyuanshu* (BL26) in the lower back; for those with radiating pain in the lateral of the lower extremity, *huantiao* (GB30), *fengshi* (GB31), *xiyangguan* (GB33), *yanglingquan* (GB34), and *xuanzhong* (GB39) on the affected side; those with radiating pain in the posterior of the lower extremity, *zhibian* (BL36), *chengfu* (BL40), *weizhong* (BL54), *chengshan* (BL57), and *kunlun* (BL60) on the affected side; and for those with radiating pain in both lateral and posterior of the lower extremity, 5 acupoints were chosen by the acupuncturists from the 10 acupoints listed (eFigure; eTable 2 in [Supplement 2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2825064#note-IOI240067-1)).  \\n  \\nFor the acupuncture group, acupuncturists used disposable stainless steel needles of varying sizes depending on the acupoint and adhesive foam pads (diameter and depth, 10.0\\u2009×\\u20095.0 mm) placed on the skin at acupoints (Suzhou Hwato Medical Instrument). For *GB30* and *BL36*, needles (0.3 × 75.0 mm) were inserted to a depth of approximately 40 to 50 mm, and for *BL25* and *BL26*, to approximately 30 to 40 mm. *De qi* sensation (soreness, numbness, distension, or heaviness) was achieved by up to 10 seconds of twirling, lifting, and thrusting manipulations, and was expected to radiate down to the affected leg. For other acupoints, needles (0.3 ×\\u200940.0 mm) were inserted to reach *de qi* sensation locally. Needles were retained in place for 30 minutes.\\n\\n>For the sham group, acupuncturists used nonacupoints away from the meridians, which are considered to have no effect; this is common practice for sham controls in acupuncture research.[^(22)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2825064#ioi240067r22) **Seven nonacupoints were preset for sham acupuncture** (eFigure; eTable 3 in [Supplement 2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2825064#note-IOI240067-1)). The same adhesive foam pads were placed and blunt-tipped needles[^(23)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2825064#ioi240067r23) (0.3\\u2009×\\u200925.0 mm; Suzhou Hwato Medical Instrument) were inserted into the pads; these needles did not penetrate the skin but stayed upright over the skin. To promote blinding, the fifth nonacupoint was performed with a conventional needle inserted to 25 to 40 mm. No manipulation was performed with no attempt to induce the *de qi* sensation. Duration and frequency of the treatment were identical to those of the acupuncture group.\",\n",

So essentially muscle memory isn’t memory in the way we think. There’s special cells called satellite cells that are recruited to your muscles during exercises that result in muscle injury. Satellite cells have been shown to remain in muscles that you work out often, I’m talking about like years. This is why people say when you stop working out and pick back up even after a year or more you get back to your original PR’s faster than it took you to reach them starting from when you began that exercise. Your body essentially keeps these cells to better prepare your muscles to grow in response any potential future exercise. In terms of muscle memory where you get better and better, let’s say at kicking, it’s because you’ve worked out the muscles for kicking for so long it, along with satellite cells, adapted to the repetitive movement. This is why you can tell when someone is a gymnast vs rock climber vs soccer player. However, in all cases, muscle memory is a use it or lose it as these cells don’t remain forever and aging will ultimately negatively impact how your body functions as well.',\n",

The study found that belief in certain purity culture principles was linked to both higher rates of sexual pain and lower satisfaction in marriages. However, women who had never internalized these beliefs tended to have more satisfying relationships.\\n\\nPurity culture gained prominence in American evangelical circles during the 1990s and 2000s. The movement emphasizes strict sexual abstinence before marriage and advocates for traditional gender roles within marriage. The ideology is centered around maintaining a woman’s “purity,” often framing premarital sex as damaging to a woman’s spiritual and physical well-being. This movement promotes the idea that women should preserve themselves as “gifts” for their husbands, discouraging behaviors deemed “provocative” to prevent inciting male desire.\\n\\nIn marriage, purity culture often portrays women as responsible for fulfilling their husbands’ sexual needs, teaching that it’s a wife’s duty to be constantly available to prevent marital problems. These teachings are frequently accompanied by metaphors, such as comparing women who have had premarital sex to “chewed-up gum” or “crumpled petals,” which can foster shame and guilt around sexuality, particularly for women.\\n\\nThe motivation behind the new study was to investigate the long-term effects of purity culture teachings on married women, specifically exploring the impacts on marital satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and sexual pain disorders. While purity culture’s rhetoric often focuses on abstinence and “saving oneself” for marriage, these teachings extend well beyond the wedding day, affecting how women view sex and their roles within marriage. Researchers Joanna Sawatsky, Rebecca Lindenbach, Sheila Wray Gregoire, and Keith Gregoire saw an important gap in understanding how these beliefs impact married women’s experiences.',\n",

They can take thousands of years to break down in the environment and the handful that have been studied in detail have been found to be toxic, with PFOA and PFOS linked to cancers and other diseases. PFAS pollution is widespread, having been found in the remotest parts of the world, and it is thought every US citizen has it in their blood.\\n\\nUsing data from an Environment Agency investigation into landfill liquid waste, which is known as leachate, Dr David Megson from Manchester Metropolitan University, who co-authored the study found “that instead of removing the banned chemicals PFOS and PFOA our treatment plants are actually creating them … likely being formed from the transformation of other PFAS within a chemical soup”.',\n",

       "      'content': 'All through my teens and 20s, I was terrified of being alone and needed relationships to validate my worth. After a relationship in my 30s, where it \"looked good\" from the outside but was really unfulfilling, challenging, and lonely on the inside, ended, I found myself. After it ended, I realized how much I was missing out on because my boyfriend and I were so so different in terms of what we enjoyed and who we were, that I wasn\\'t doing the things that really made me happy, or if I was, I often felt guilty because it was so clear he wasn\\'t enjoying them/didn\\'t want to be there. When we broke up, I started traveling way more. I\\'d go out to lunch by myself, go to the beach by myself. I lived alone. When I traveled, I went and did ALL the things that interested me, no matter how off beat, niche, or weird others might perceive them to be. If I thought it had a shot of making me happy, I would try it. I found so much joy in my home hobbies like cooking and reading, going to concert became my big thing too, and I enjoy working out. I have 2 dogs, good friends, and a nice smaller social network at my job and a close relationship with my mom and sister, so I never felt lonely. And now, at 38, I think I\\'ve hit a point it would be very very hard for me to get into a relationship again. I am so ridiculously happy on my own, and honestly, at this stage in the game, men kind of gross me out. I don\\'t find many attractive anymore, my interest in sex is non-existent, and I just find relationships that begin at this age require way too much compromise that I am no longer willing to give because I don\\'t feel the trade off is worth it. It would take a really insanely great man to feel like relationship compromise would be worth trading out some of my own solo happinesses if required, and let\\'s be real... that just isn\\'t something that exists anymore. And with the advent of dating apps, I don\\'t know if I could ever fully trust a man completely. None of those risks to my happiness are worth the potential \"reward\". I know a lot of people think single women just \"say\" they are happy so they don\\'t \"look pathetic\", but honestly, I am probably the happiest I\\'ve been in 20 years. My biggest regret is I didn\\'t feel this happy or confident when I was in my 20s. That girl deserved this happiness, too.',\n",

In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:\\n\\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19485506241287960\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nThe experience of singles has been largely overlooked in relationship science, garnering a need for understanding correlates of singles’ well-being. Gender is an important focus of well-being research, and qualitative work on singlehood has suggested that men and women may have experiences of singlehood that differ in important ways. In this study (N = 5941; 50% men; Mage = 31.74), we provide the first comprehensive, descriptive profile of gender differences on a suite of variables with important ties to well-being in singlehood; satisfaction with relationship status, life satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and desire for a partner. Our results suggest that single women, on average, report higher levels of satisfaction with relationship status, life satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and lower desire for a partner. Exploratory analyses showed significant gender interactions with age and ethnicity. Overall, these findings suggest that women are, on average, happier in singlehood than men.\\n\\nFrom the linked article:\\n\\nWhy Women Like Being Single More Than Men Do\\n\\nWomen take to single life more readily than men, new research finds.\\n\\nIn Every Way, Women Were Happier Than Men with Their Single Lives\\n\\nOn every question that was asked in the study, single women were more comfortable than single men with their single lives. They were happier with their current romantic relationship status. They were less likely to want a romantic partner. They were more sexually satisfied. And they were more satisfied with their life in general.\\n\\nWhere single women really stood out from single men, and partnered women, was in their satisfaction with their romantic relationship status. On average, single life suits single women. They like it and they are not very interested in being in a romantic relationship.',\n",

People struggle to imagine that single men might experience something negative that isn't their fault. In the same way, they struggle to imagine that a man could be single at all without it being his fault. Again, women do experience something similar but it is not as strong. People can imagine reasons for them being single that don't make them deficient. Even if those reasons aren't always the first ones to come to mind, they can imagine them and will generally do so if they happen to like the woman.\",\n",

Some of these are cultural:\\n\\n> oh I'm having sex with them but I'm still single. \\n\\nIs not a statement evenly distributed across both sexes. Therefore sexual satisfaction while 'single' will not be the same across both sexes. \\n\\nOther differences are material. Others in the thread have pointed out how women who are more emotionally satisfied within a committed relationship command more ability to be in one or start a new one if their existing partnership ends. But I would argue that this is true across the entire relationship spectrum from committed to frivolous. \\n\\nThus, women, even outside of committed relationships, have much more power to achieve whatever type of non-committal sexual relationship(s) they find appealing week to week. So what you're really measuring, in part, is women's dominance of the sexaul marketplace. While interesting, it isn't exactly breaking new ground to notice this in 2024.\\n\\nIn regards to non-sexual relationships, there may be more fertile ground to play in academically. But we could at least notice that most exclusively male spaces and stereotypical activities have either been: \\n\\n* made illegal \\n\\n* delegitimized by being labelled toxic or problematic. \\n\\n* or face social pressure to allow women in.\\n\\nMen's notable lack of friendship with other males is partly due to atomizing cultural tides that have affected everyone, but also due to a systematic destruction of male-only spaces and activities. The most notable of this being the workplace which used to be effectively 100% segregated. Even if men and women worked at the same companies, or even in the same department's and offices at those companies, they would rarely ever work closely together. However, this type of work environment is illegal in America (and most Western countries) post the civil rights regime of the 1960s and illegal to produce even by accident under modern court's interpretation of disparate impact. \\n\\nThe gender segregated workplace has the honor of falling into all three categories listed above. It was made to allow women in by the force of law, and holdouts of male dominated workplaces face delegitimization efforts by being labelled problematic. Hence the term '____ bro' to describe finance and tech. And also Bernie supports who caught some strays (interesting sociological affect merits further study).\",\n",

Single men are not given attention.\\n\\nI think the biggest thing people are missing here is that single women receive a lot more attention than single men. Dating apps, social media, and society in general heavily favors giving attention to women (especially single women) over men.\\n\\nAttention, arguably the most important social need, is given to women through those things without nearly as much effort men would need to put in. Is it always positive attention? Hell no, but a mix of attention is almost always better than none at all.\\n\\nSo why would single women risk losing their current attention needs with a partner that might not be able to give that much attention?\",\n",

It seems like a question that could have been answered if the data were organized to do so. I *don\\'t* think that perspectives remain the same as one gains experience and ages.\\n\\nJust off the cuff, my guess is that girls are more often \"parentified\" in their own homes as they grow up, which means they are places in more adult and responsible roles as far as chores and expectations. Boys, as they grow up, are generally treated the opposite and catered to more, so they have fewer skills that would allow them to live alone adequately.\\n\\nThat\\'s a vast generalization and a guess, based on how one culture tends to do things. Then (in that specific culture) young women would have an easier time on their own, as it would be almost like a break from work; they\\'d be doing what they know, but only for themselves instead of for a household. Men, on the other hand, are suddenly helpless with no mother-figure around to take care of them. It\\'s harder. \\n\\nOf course in later life everyone generally has enough experience to manage things themselves, and could form opinions free from the circumstances in which they were raised.',\n",

She was genuinely puzzled because in her mind i’m an above average man in both looks and social status. It wasn’t until I explained to her the asymmetry of the sexual marketplace when it started to make sense to her.\\n\\nin her own words dating as a single woman felt like doing online shopping. Just like picking new clothes on a webshop she might want to buy, the dating app felt like ‘picking’ men she might want to sleep with. \\n\\nFor me the experience feels more like a game of chairs, where i’m lucky to be the ‘winner’ every now and then. And ‘win’ only secures me a match. Going on an actual date with said match is another added layer of chance.\\n\\nIn other words, dating for a single woman reflects a market of abundance, whereas for most men it’s existing in a market of scarcity. \\n\\nIt’s that very scarcity that can make me anxious at times, because even though personally I don’t have as much trouble as many other men when it come to having sexual encounter, I do still feel like my chances of finding a long term romantic partner are relatively low, in part because I’m noticing a lot of the women i’ve been with since then often show a reluctance to become exclusive, presumably because of that very abundance they experience in online. \\n\\nThey won’t say it outright, but I can imagine if you feel you can pick almost any man on these apps, intuitively why would she settle for me if tomorrow she could match with a guy with better looks and higher status?\\n\\nIn an ironic twist this emancipation + abundance for women has made me feel weirdly objectified during and after some of these sexual encounters.',\n",

So many dudes assuming the main reasons women are fine being single is because they compensate by having lots of friends and casual hookups. When in reality, a lot of single women I know don’t have a huge circle of friends, and don’t do casual sex at all.\\n\\nThese guys’ line of thinking totally disregards the fact that in hookups, women statistically are still less likely to orgasm than the man, are the ones who bear the risk of unwanted pregnancy, and a lot of single women just aren’t hooking up nearly as much as men think (men seem to think “if I were a woman I’d have casual sex all the time because it would be so easy to find it” and don’t realize that a lot of women absolutely do not feel the same way). \\n\\nAnyway what I was getting at was that a lot of men don’t realize that many women are fine with being alone and even celibate because for some, the burden a relationship can become might not feel worth it. A good and equal partner absolutely enriches one’s life, but if a relationship turns into a situation where the woman is on any level a “bangmaid,” the sex and companionship can stop feeling worth putting up with that kind of attitude.

       "      'content': 'The main points raised in the article\\n\\nA study published in *The International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine* found a positive link between omega-3 intake and improved cognitive abilities in adults over 60. By analysing dietary and cognitive test data from 2,430 older adults, researchers discovered that those with higher omega-3 intake performed better in memory, executive function, and processing speed. The results indicated that moderate levels of omega-3 offered the most significant benefits, while excessive amounts provided limited additional improvements. The study suggests that omega-3 could be a beneficial dietary factor for cognitive health, although more research is needed to confirm a causal relationship. The article does not specify the dosages involved.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Appropriate Dosage Levels:** \\n\\nWhile the article provides no guidelines on dosage, Omega-3 dosage recommendations generally focus on the combined intake of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), two essential omega-3 fats. Moderate intakes of 500 to 1,000 mg daily are often recommended for cognitive benefits, typically achievable through a balanced diet that includes fish or supplements. Many experts caution against exceeding 3,000 mg per day from all sources, as high levels may not provide additional cognitive benefits and could lead to side effects, particularly for individuals on blood-thinning medications. It is always advisable to consult a healthcare provider for personalised recommendations.',\n",

Researchers found that people with higher fluid intelligence, a form of general reasoning ability, were more likely to adjust their attitudes after receiving corrective information. Interestingly, an individual’s motivation to think deeply—what psychologists call “need for cognition”—had little effect on attitude change. This suggests that the ability to reason through new information is more influential than simply being motivated to engage with it.\\n\\nThe rise of misinformation, particularly online, has posed serious challenges for societies aiming to foster well-informed public discourse. In recent years, efforts to combat misinformation have often focused on fact-checking and correction strategies, but not all individuals respond to corrections in the same way. Understanding why some people adjust their beliefs while others do not could help improve debunking strategies.\\n\\nThe study’s authors wanted to explore whether personal characteristics like fluid intelligence (the ability to think and reason quickly and abstractly) or need for cognition (the desire to engage in effortful thinking) could predict who is more likely to update their attitudes in response to corrected information.',\n",

       "      'content': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312005843\\n\\nFrom the General Discussion section:\\n\\n\"The results presented here provide evidence to support the view that human intelligence is not unitary but, rather, is formed from multiple cognitive components. These components reflect the way in which the brain regions that have previously been implicated in intelligence are organized into functionally specialized networks and, moreover, when the tendency for cognitive tasks to recruit a combination of these functional networks is accounted for, there is little evidence for a higher-order intelligence factor. Further evidence for the relative independence of these components may be drawn from the fact that they correlate with questionnaire variables in a dissociable manner. Taken together, it is reasonable to conclude that human intelligence is most parsimoniously conceived of as an emergent property of multiple specialized brain systems, each of which has its own capacity.\\n\\nHistorically, research into the biological basis of intelligence has been limited by a circular logic regarding the definition of what exactly intelligence is. More specifically, general intelligence may sensibly be defined as the factor or factors that contribute to an individual’s ability to perform across a broad range of cognitive tasks. In practice, however, intelligence is typically defined as “g,” which in turn is defined as the measure taken by classical pen and paper IQ tests such as Raven’s matrices (Raven, 1938) or the Cattell Culture Fair (Cattell, 1949). If a more diverse set of paradigms are applied and, as a consequence, a more diverse set of first-order components are derived, the conventional approach is to run a second-order factor analysis in order to generate a higher-order component. In order for the battery to be considered a good measure of general intelligence, this higher-order component should correlate with “g” as measured by a classical IQ test. The results presented here suggest that such higher-order constructs should be used with caution. On the one hand, a higher-order component may be used to generate a more interpretable first-order factor solution, for example, when cognitive tasks load heavily on multiple components. On the other hand, the basis of the higher-order component is ambiguous and may be accounted for by cognitive tasks corecruiting multiple functionally dissociable brain networks. Consequently, to interpret a higher-order component as representing a dominant unitary factor is misleading.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, from a phenomenological perspective, the idea that tasks tend to corecruit multiple functional brain networks makes intuitive sense, as generating a task that depends on any single cognitive process is likely to be rather intractable. Consider a simple working memory task, in which the spatial locations of a sequence of flashes must be observed, maintained, and repeated (spatial span). Even in this simple context, the participant must comprehend the written instructions, otherwise, they may report the correct locations but in the incorrect sequence. More importantly, people often apply chunking strategies when encoding information in short-term memory in order to generate a more efficient memory trace. For example, they may note that the flashes form the outline of a geometric shape. Such “chunking” strategies are a form of logical transformation and are known to recruit the IFS (Bor et al., 2001). Thus, even in the most simple of task contexts, all three of the cognitive systems identified in the current study would play a role but to varying extents.\"\\n\\nSenior investigator for the study to CBC Canada:\\n\\n\"We have shown categorically that you cannot sum up the difference between people in terms of one number, and that is really what is important here.\"\\n\\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/iq-myth-debunked-by-canadian-researchers-1.1264832',\n",

I heard about it when I was going to an MMA gym in Hamilton, Ontario (Joslins). There's actually four cycles to it: Corrective Phase, Base Conditioning Phase, Strength Phase, and Power Phase. Each phase has two distinct routines that you alternate between for about 4 weeks before moving to the next one. Corrective phase is only needed the first time around to fix any muscle discrepancies or you can revisit it if you think you're lacking something. \\n\\nThere are also cardio/conditioning blocks associated with each phase but I tend to just incorporate long runs into my routine these days because I'm not competing in combat sports any more but I like the program for the weight lifting aspects since it keeps me doing a variety of exercises and a lot of good core stuff. \\n\\nEric also has a lot of great programs for pain related to hips, shoulders, wrists, lower back, and a bunch of other areas as well as programs for flexibility, mobility, etc. I can only speak to my own experience but I have done some hip programs of his and found them more effective and comprehensive than the physio I was seeing at the time.\",\n",

Making them functional and mature is really, really, really difficult. We can make pretty good muscle cells by over expressing a single gene, but it takes more to make them adult, working, contracting muscle cells that form big functional fibres. \\n\\nAI might be able to help with this part, the way genes get turned on or off to determine what cell type they become is often obscenely complicated. Taking lots of genetic data and using AI to find how all these genetic networks fit together is an area where GPTs might actually excell, it's being worked on and some early models with small sequencing datasets are coming out. \\n\\nAnother issue is scale up, growing some of these cells in a flat dish is relatively simple these days. But a single-cell thick sheet isn't very helpful. Growing actual tissue on a larger scale is a big issue. How do you grow a big lump of tissue while getting nutrients and oxygen to the cells inside? How do you actually connect that lump to a living person? \\n\\nThere's all sorts of research going on with scaffolds to support the growth of cells in 3D to achieve this. Or even growing cells in living animals that can use their blood supply.\\n\\nIt's a problem also shared with the lab grown meat industry, most companies in that space are capable of making good enough quality muscle and fat cells, but doing that at large scale efficiently is an entirely different challenge.\",\n",

       "      'content': '>Treating anxiety, depression and other disorders may depend on the amygdala, a part of the brain that controls strong emotional reactions, especially fear. But a deep understanding of this structure has been lacking. Now scientists at the University of California, Davis have identified new clusters of cells with differing patterns of gene expression in the amygdala of humans and non-human primates. The work could lead to more targeted treatments for disorders such as anxiety that affect tens of millions of people. \\n\\n>The researchers searched for specific cell types that expressed the genes implicated in anxiety and other disorders in humans. This strategy can help identify cell types that are most likely to give rise to psychopathology, Fox said.\\xa0\\n>\\n>For example, they identified a specific group of cells that expressed a gene called FOXP2. The new study shows that in humans and macaques, FOXP2 is expressed in cells on the edges of the amygdala, called intercalated cells. Excitingly, researchers have demonstrated that in rodents, this small group of FOXP2-expressing cells play a role as “gatekeepers,” controlling signal traffic in or out of the amygdala. Together, these data suggest intercalated cells to be a potentially powerful avenue for developing treatments.\\n>\\n>The researchers were also able to identify both similarities and differences between cell types in the human and non-human primate amygdala. This is important for understanding how discoveries in animal models of disorders such as anxiety and autism relate to humans.\\xa0\\n>\\n>The approach could help identify cell types as potential drug targets. For example, FOXP2-expressing cells tend to express both anxiety-related genes and a receptor that can be targeted by drugs, called Neuropeptide FF Receptor 2 (NPFFR2). This result can guide the development of new treatment strategies, by suggesting drugs that activate the NPFFR2 pathway as a potential treatment target in relation to anxiety-related disorders.\\xa0\\n\\nPaper (not open access): [Translational Insights From Cell Type Variation Across Amygdala Subnuclei in Rhesus Monkeys and Humans | American Journal of Psychiatry](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.20230602)',\n",

       "      'content': 'I’ve linked to the primary source, the journal article, in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to a news release: \\n\\nhttps://studyfinds.org/masculinity-heart-disease/\\n\\nFrom the linked article: \\n\\nDoes masculinity shorten lifespans? This study suggests ‘manly’ men at higher risk of heart problems\\n\\nMen who strongly conform to traditionally masculine behaviors are significantly less likely to receive crucial diagnoses and treatment for serious cardiovascular conditions, according to new research. The study suggests that societal pressure on men to appear tough and self-reliant may be literally putting their hearts at risk.\\n\\nResearchers from the University of Chicago say this pattern begins as early as adolescence and continues into adulthood, potentially putting these men at greater risk for future cardiovascular problems. Their study, published in JAMA Network Open, followed over 4,000 American men from their teenage years through early adulthood, examining how their degree of “male gender expressivity” (MGE) – essentially, how closely they conform to typical male behavioral patterns – affected their likelihood of being diagnosed with and treated for conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes.\\n\\nThe research team found that men who displayed higher levels of masculine behavior were significantly less likely to receive diagnoses for these conditions, even when medical tests showed they had them. For instance, among men with elevated blood pressure, those with higher MGE scores were 4% less likely to receive a hypertension diagnosis. The effect was even more dramatic for diabetes, where men with higher adolescent MGE scores were 15% less likely to receive a diagnosis when their blood sugar levels indicated they had the condition.\\n\\nPerhaps most troubling, even when these men did receive diagnoses, they were less likely to follow through with treatment. Among men who had already received a hypertension diagnosis, those who displayed more masculine behaviors in adolescence were 11% less likely to take prescribed blood pressure medications. Similarly, men showing higher masculine traits in young adulthood were 7% less likely to take blood pressure medications and 10% less likely to take diabetes medications when diagnosed with these conditions.\\n\\n“Our hypothesis is that social pressures are leading to behavioral differences that impact cardiovascular risk mitigation efforts, which is concerning because it could be leading to worse long-term health outcomes,” Glasser adds.',\n",

If a man feels led on and used they're going to actively avoid doing it. If men are paying a woman's way, giving them attention, giving them validation and they get back none of what they want from the interactions then they're going to feel used and stop doing those things altogether. Women teach men to be domineering, not to be kind, to act controlling and make demands because that's what produces the results they're looking for.\\n\\nIf men are domineering and women simply reject them for it instead of letting them take them out repeatedly and pay their way then that's an improvement for men. They're free to move on to the next woman quickly and at little cost until it does work for them.\\n\\nIf women wanted men to be kind to them they would make being kind have better results than being domineering but that's not what we see in reality. In reality kindness costs time and money, you need to invest in the other person and every step a man takes in that direction the more they're going to expect in return. If they don't get what they want in return over time they're going to recognize that it doesn't work and try other things. Maybe they'll ask other men what works for them and you know what works? Being dominant. That's what successful men tell other men. Women who don't want a dominant guy aren't going to want to be around you so they'll just reject you, which is fine, no big deal, guys don't care about rejection, it's a constant, they'll just move on to the next one and the next and the next, ... Until it does work for them and they find a woman who will accept their dominant demeanor and then they can get what they want and decide to be kind or not afterwards.\\n\\nThe reason why it works doesn't matter, men might have different theories on why it works, like women unknowingly want it, but that's just an irrelevant detail because it does produce results. \\n\\nBeing domineering takes little time, energy, or money, you can be domineering towards a dozen women every day and experience no negative consequences, as opposed to being kind and investing in a woman which takes much time, energy and money and has no greater chance of success while also limiting the number of attempts a man can make.\",\n",

However, as is the case with many things, eating too much of it is bad for you. Despite the strong evidence associating red meat with some cancers, the underlying mechanism is less clear.\\n\\nNow, [researchers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38885349/) from the National Cancer Center Singapore (NCCS), together with scientists from Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), have identified the mechanism linking the excessive consumption of red meat to colorectal cancer.\\n\\nWorldwide, colorectal cancer, which affects the large intestine or rectum, is the third most common cancer, accounting for around 10% of cancer cases. It’s also the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. In addition to age and family history, lifestyle factors such as diet, inactivity, obesity, smoking, and excess alcohol consumption can increase the risk of this type of cancer.\\n\\nUsing fresh colorectal cancer samples, the researchers discovered that the iron in red meat reactivated the enzyme telomerase via an iron-sensing protein called Pirin, which drove the progression of the cancer. Now, this requires stepping back to explain the importance of telomerase and telomeres and their relation to cancer growth.',\n",

These free ends can fuse together, combining chromosomes which causes big issues during cell division.

No. They are just comparing a big group of people who exercised more on a single day with those who exercised less on a single day, and trying to *control* stratistically for all the other differences that also affect blood pressure - things like jobs, diets, education, stress, alcohol, drugs, sleep, smoking, etc. Note that they actually can only adjust for self-reported age, sex, alcohol, smoking, plus in some cohorts education and job status and disability.\\n\\nSo how much exercise was associated with a *clinically meaningful* difference in blood pressure, after trying to control for age, sex, alcohol, smoking, and some other bits?\\n\\n>Clinically meaningful improvements in SBP and DBP were estimated after 20 to 27 minutes and 10 to 15 minutes of reallocation of time in other behaviors into additional exercise.\\n\\nThis means converting 15 minutes of standing a day into exercise could be associated with a 1 mmHg decrease in DBP, and changing 27 minutes of sleeping into exercise might be associated with a 2 mmHg decrease in SBP.\\n\\n5 minutes of exercise replacing sedentary behaviour was estimated to be associated with a –0.68 mmHg decrease in SBP, but there was a wide margin of error of –0.15 to –1.21. For DBP, it was –0.54mmHg (margin of error –0.19 to –0.89).\\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nWhat does this really mean? It means adding 5 minutes of exercise would have no discernibly meaningful impact on your blood pressure and thus on your risk of cardiovascular disease.

Trials are not a desperate shot in the dark from an untested treatment, they are innovative but powerful new options that can make a real difference to you. Good luck!!\",\n",

I started treatment in October after taking a trip to Maui to really think about it and enjoy what might be my last vacation. Filed for disability. Started AAVD, it was rough and it didn’t work for me. Big ol tumor popped up on my neck about 3.5 weeks after finishing the regimen. Didn’t even make it to the pet scan. \\n\\nSo then I did pembro-Ice. Inpatient chemo is so miserable. But it worked. Got me into remission and was deemed a good candidate for an autologous transplant. This is around the time things went really south. The pembro made my immune system attack my joints and my whole damn body was locking up and swelling and racked with pain. My joint’s literally filled with fluid and I had to take a massive dose of steroids to deal with it. It never fully went away but I can walk again. This side effect and hospitalization caused my transplant to be delayed by about 3 weeks. \\n\\nI signed up for a clinical trial where a radio isotope is attached to an antibody that delivers the isotope directly to Hodgkins cells , destroying them. This is called Y90- labeled anti CD-25 antibody. I received the infusion of radiation and had a relatively uneventful week (just lots of joint pain ) until the transplant regimen started. BEAM is the name of the chemo mix. 6 day infusion that wipes out ur bone marrow. On day 7 they give me my stem cells back to regrow the marrow. Then 3 days later I wake up just feeling crushed by this fuvkin poison bullshit. Puking , shitting and pissing blood! , my mouth and throat felt like they were full of razor blades. Absolutely miserable. I believe the side effects of the beam were compounded by the radio isotope. But I started to feel better after about a week and a half of pure misery in the hospital. They discharged me after 12 days from transplant when my cell counts started to go up. \\n\\nAt home I still felt like shit most of the time. Joint pain, puking, sadness blah. \\nThen I started to puke like I’ve never puked before. Then I got a slight cough. Checked my temp and it was 102 and climbing so I drove an hour and a half to the transplant ward and checked in. They think it’s double pneumonia and “ lungs” the pulmonologist orders a ct scan. Lungs tells me he thinks my lungs could be filling with blood and I might have very little time so I start freaking out obviously and have my family come see me immediately. He preforms a broncoscopy for the next day and tells me my lungs look great. My oxygen stats are at 85 without oxygen so they send me Home on high dose steroids and oxygen after a week. \\n\\nThis is when I finally start to feel better! For the first time a long time. I’m still in pain a bit from the whole joints turning to mush episode but I’m off the oxygen and able to take decent walks again. I don’t wanna rush into anything so I’m gonna stay on disability and live with my parents for a while and go to community college. Slowly rebuild myself. I have been eating much healthier and drinking lots of water. I don’t think I can go back to agriculture any time soon because it’s too physically demanding. I am considering perusing a bachelors in nursing. Given my health condition continues to head in the right direction I would love to use my life to pay it forward. I can’t feel any new lumps and my last 2 scans have been clear. I feel like I’m able to connect with my family and fiancé again. I don’t feel like a hairless alien organism barely clinging to life by basking it’s insides a toxic soup. I can laugh again. I am cleaning the house and cooking again. I think there is hope for some real good times after all this even if my pain never really goes away. Or even if the cancer comes back. I think it may have all been worth it. ',\n",

I found out about a month ago that the chemo wasn't working anymore. Back in June, my scans were clear, but by September, the cancer was back, worse than before my last surgery in March. The plan was to explore clinical trials, but then we hit another roadblock: a new mass was found in my breast, completely unrelated to the ovarian cancer I've been dealing with.\\n\\nAn MRI in August came back with a BIRADS score of 4, which required further investigation. A biopsy was scheduled earlier this month, but during the ultrasound-guided procedure, the radiologist couldn't locate the suspicious mass from the MRI. He referred me to a breast surgeon instead, to spare me an unnecessary biopsy. Then, Hurricane Milton delayed my appointment with the specialist by another week.\\n\\nWhen I finally saw the surgeon, they did a punch biopsy, but today I got the call that the results were benign. It should have been good news, but the surgeon isn't satisfied with the sample—it was too small, and the area doesn’t match what the original MRI showed. Now, I need a mammogram-guided biopsy.\\n\\nI get that they want to be thorough, but this is what's standing between me and getting into clinical trials. I haven't had any treatment in two months, and that's too long to let the cancer keep growing. I just broke down trying to reach my oncology team to figure out how to speed this up without losing another month or two that I don’t have. I'm angry—at the system, at how long everything takes, at the sheer inefficiency of it all. It feels like my life is on hold, and time is running out.\\n\\nUpdate: A nurse coordinator helped speed things up, and I’m officially scheduled for a biopsy next week, followed by a follow-up the week after. There’s not much else I can do right now except to follow the plan that’s been set.\",\n",

       "    'selftext': \"I (23F) was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer almost a year ago.  Before I was diagnosed, I had very few symptoms, extreme fatigue (which I didn't think much of as I am a nurse and am on my feet all day) and blood in my stool.  My PCP thought it would be best for me to have a colonoscopy even though she was sure it had something to do with my having a female reproductive system.  I went and had the colonoscopy and they found a tumor in my colon about the size of a golf ball.  I was then referred to the cancer center in my area for further testing.  I met with the GI surgical team before having anything looked at and was told that (hopefully) it hadn't spread and it would be a quick and easy surgery.  It was found to have spread to my liver and both lungs via the lymphatic system. Since then I have gone through 6 months of chemo, a bowel resection, and then a left lung resection.  The liver was looked at before and during my bowel surgery, but the Drs couldn't see anything and decided it would be best to leave it and monitor it in the future.  I was supposed to be entered into a clinical trial for a chemo diffused directly into the right lung (this lung had more and larger mets) during surgery as a way of fully clearing out the cancer.  I went for an MRI Saturday to make sure the liver hadn't changed as part of the criteria for this trial was stability of all other mets.  Today I went to see my oncologist and I received the unfortunate news that there are around 15 lesions in my liver and both lungs have growing tumors. This means that it is terminal and I will have to be on chemo for the rest of my life.  I'm honestly not sure how to feel about this.  I wasn't given any sort of life expectancy so I have no idea what to prepare for.  I feel like I'm supposed to have my whole life ahead of me and now it's being taken away from me. (and obviously I know it's so much worse for kids who are diagnosed and I'm 100% grateful for the life I've lived so far but I feel like I'm allowed to be angry right now) Anyways, sorry for the long post but I really needed to get this out.\",\n",

Meaning it cannot be treated anymore.\\n\\nThursday I go to another hospital (more expertise with cancer) to get a second opinion.\\n\\nI'm a 37y old man with a very healthy lifestyle (no smoking, no alcohol, healthy food, I train 15-20h per week for triathlon).\\n\\nI can imagine how you feel right now. This is so unreal. \\n\\nHope for you that the chemo can stabilize it and you don't suffer too much from it. \\n\\nBr\",\n",

I have been a NET research patient for almost 10 years now in the US between Johns Hopkins and NIH (National Institute of Health). \\n\\nHowever, with the recent election results here in the US, there is a real possibility that Trump (or RFKjr if he takes a health position in the administration), will heavily cut funding for health and health research. Trump already cut funding for NIH the last time he was in office and it led to them pulling travel and living assistance from their NET research patients (amongst others). \\n\\nI am terrified that funding might be further cut leading to me losing other assistance I desperately need, like my Lanreotide shots (I can neither afford them without major assistance and they are literally keeping me alive along with the research program itself). I am also on SSDI due to the side effects and the fact my NETs are incurable and I will be in active treatment for the rest of my life unless breakthroughs are made. I am also concerned about Trump messing with social security but for now, my focus is on potential cuts to research funding affecting access to my medication and treatment.\\n\\nSo... I am now preparing for the possibility that Trump\\'s incoming presidency will lead to my bankruptcy and death if I do not take precautions. And so research has begun. Here are my questions for the community:\\n\\n1. What are the best centers for NET research outside the USA?\\n2. Are there studies you are aware of that are outside the USA and looking for candidates?\\n3. Do these studies offer financial support in any way?\\n4.

Last Monday I received my post surgical check up where I found out I\\'ll possibly be waiting for more treatment within the next 6 months. It wasn\\'t the good news of \"cancer free\" I wanted to hear. In a moment of weakness I asked to go past the animal shelter.\\n\\nMy family had been looking for a second cat for the year and had recently missed out on 2 kittens. One was adopted by another family and the second injured in the care of the lost dogs home.\\n\\nBy pure chance there was one female, medium hair kitten left of her litter. A 12 week old we called Jiji. We took her home... and things were not great.\\n\\nAt first I was distracted. The hours spent playing and restructuring my room provided something to occupy my mind other than the cancer. Jiji was cuddily and wanting of my attention.\\n\\nThen lethargy and exhaustion hit me... I layed down and Jiji began to wizz around full of energy. She wouldn\\'t accept any other toy but she fishing rod. I ended up playing while laying down exhausted, slowing in the hopes to bore her...\\n\\nThen I began to miss my other cat, Jinx. Jinx has been my rock throughout my diagnosis. I\\'m not a social person and so sitting and jury being in the same room as Jinx made me feel better. Jinx had very quickly began to isolate herself hiding in wardrobes, not eating her favourite treats and eventually hissing at me.\\n\\nMy heart was breaking. I felt like I had hurt Jinx when I needed her most.\\n\\nWhen I went to go to sleep Jiji was still wizzing. She was jumping on my chest and without awareness of her claws, scraping me. With my bandage on me neck I got scared. I didn\\'t have the energy to play and I was worried she might accidentally hurt my wound as the scar isn\\'t fully formed yet. On top of this I just wanted some time to grieve myself tbh...\\n\\nI felt so bad... Jiji had to sleep alone in the bathroom and my cat who had slept by my side the night before my surgery previously was now hiding from me.\\n\\nThe rescue centre on top of this, only gave us 2 days to decide weather or not Jiji was fit for the home without financial repercussions (something I have to think about unfortunately due to hospice costs...) Not enough time to really tell if the cats would be okay together...\\n\\nI think it was a rush decision to distract from my health and backfired when I temporarily lost the trust of my emotional support kitty Jinx. I cried day and night for 2 days out of fear for my senior as she was isolating. I avoided jiji at times because I simply did not have the energy.\\n\\nI felt like I was hurting everyone. The cats and my parents who thought this would be a good change. I feel guilty for being so emotional. If I hadn\\'t cried... maybe Jiji would still be with us. I feel like it\\'s all my fault still.\\n\\nAt times I wanted \"my cat\" to cuddle and hold in my time of pain and I had hurt her by bringing a new baby home.\\n\\nIt was only 2 days with Jiji. I wanted to try and wait a week but my parents packed her up and returned her on the last day for the eligible refund... part of me wishes to have waited but I know my parents simply wanted to rip off the bandaid sooner rather than later... so that jiji wouldn\\'t be bonded and neither would I.\\n\\nAn hour after she was gone my cat Jinx began to cuddle and rub all over me, roll onto her back for belly rubs and eat treats. I know in my heart it was the probably the right choice. I think I was and still are blaming myself a lot. I think my Mum is wounded by giving up a cat. She cried returning Jiji and also from causing me emotional distress for 3 days... I know she meant well. I dont blame her. I don\\'t want her to feel at fault either. It all just makes me feel even more to blame.\\n\\nI think it was just the right cat wrong time considering my health and Jinx has been so happy since things have gone back to normal...maybe she\\'s just a solo cat.\\n\\nI miss Jiji more than I thought I would. She was adopted very soon after returning her within 5 hours. What\\'s done is done... but I still feel bad. I still feel to blame.\\n\\nI hate cancer and I hate myself for feeling so weak emotionally and physically all the time... People keep telling me it was the right thing to do... but then why do I feel like it\\'s still my fault.\\n\\nI don\\'t know weather to keep or delete the photos of Jiji. I don\\'t want to forget her... ',\n",

Still: lots of things in my mind. \\n\\nM24, got a Stage 3 Synovial sarcoma, left tonsil, on my birthday in August. I live in Germany so there is a decent health system and I'm treated at two hospitals, one for the chemotherapy that is specialised on blood cancers, and later on for the surgery in January in a sarcoma center. I'm getting the AIM protocol.\\n\\nDespite all of the positive things I've heard and seen from my doctors - the CT was good, the tumor shrunk and is but a little pea (5cm size, now 1cm); the aggressiveness of this particular tumor being rather low (all I know is that Ki67 is 30%); the tumor taking a lot of damage through the chemo; and I barely feel any side effects, hell, last time I experienced none except for a little headache.\\n\\nAnd still I sit here asking what comes after. You know this feeling? Maybe you defeated your cancer already and know what I mean. \\n\\nI'll have my final chemo on christmas, which is okay, I'll take it as a Christmas gift that they'll annihilate that Alien in my mouth. \\n\\nBut even when the surgery is done and even if there is a R0 resection, even knowing that the tumor has gotten close to the artery but hasn't infiltrate it - will it come back? \\n\\nAfter a depression I defeated, I became a new person, much more optimistic and uplifting, and I still am. I won't stop my studies, I want to become a teacher, no matter what. But I've heard sarcomas like to have a revanche. Doctors said my chances are good, but what if it lays eggs? \\n\\nThat's the only thing that scares me. I hope you all are alright or will be alright again. Love y'all. I don't know.

I sought comfort and sound advice to help prevent me from sabotaging myself. I have had to reschedule a PET in the past because I did not follow the guidelines.

       "    'selftext': 'I was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin’s disease in September of 2023. I started treatment in October after taking a trip to Maui to really think about it and enjoy what might be my last vacation. Filed for disability. Started AAVD, it was rough and it didn’t work for me. Big ol tumor popped up on my neck about 3.5 weeks after finishing the regimen. Didn’t even make it to the pet scan. \\n\\nSo then I did pembro-Ice. Inpatient chemo is so miserable. But it worked. Got me into remission and was deemed a good candidate for an autologous transplant. This is around the time things went really south. The pembro made my immune system attack my joints and my whole damn body was locking up and swelling and racked with pain. My joint’s literally filled with fluid and I had to take a massive dose of steroids to deal with it. It never fully went away but I can walk again. This side effect and hospitalization caused my transplant to be delayed by about 3 weeks. \\n\\nI signed up for a clinical trial where a radio isotope is attached to an antibody that delivers the isotope directly to Hodgkins cells , destroying them. This is called Y90- labeled anti CD-25 antibody. I received the infusion of radiation and had a relatively uneventful week (just lots of joint pain ) until the transplant regimen started. BEAM is the name of the chemo mix. 6 day infusion that wipes out ur bone marrow. On day 7 they give me my stem cells back to regrow the marrow. Then 3 days later I wake up just feeling crushed by this fuvkin poison bullshit. Puking , shitting and pissing blood! , my mouth and throat felt like they were full of razor blades. Absolutely miserable. I believe the side effects of the beam were compounded by the radio isotope. But I started to feel better after about a week and a half of pure misery in the hospital. They discharged me after 12 days from transplant when my cell counts started to go up. \\n\\nAt home I still felt like shit most of the time. Joint pain, puking, sadness blah. \\nThen I started to puke like I’ve never puked before. Then I got a slight cough. Checked my temp and it was 102 and climbing so I drove an hour and a half to the transplant ward and checked in. They think it’s double pneumonia and “ lungs” the pulmonologist orders a ct scan. Lungs tells me he thinks my lungs could be filling with blood and I might have very little time so I start freaking out obviously and have my family come see me immediately. He preforms a broncoscopy for the next day and tells me my lungs look great. My oxygen stats are at 85 without oxygen so they send me Home on high dose steroids and oxygen after a week. \\n\\nThis is when I finally start to feel better! For the first time a long time. I’m still in pain a bit from the whole joints turning to mush episode but I’m off the oxygen and able to take decent walks again. I don’t wanna rush into anything so I’m gonna stay on disability and live with my parents for a while and go to community college. Slowly rebuild myself. I have been eating much healthier and drinking lots of water. I don’t think I can go back to agriculture any time soon because it’s too physically demanding. I am considering perusing a bachelors in nursing. Given my health condition continues to head in the right direction I would love to use my life to pay it forward. I can’t feel any new lumps and my last 2 scans have been clear. I feel like I’m able to connect with my family and fiancé again. I don’t feel like a hairless alien organism barely clinging to life by basking it’s insides a toxic soup. I can laugh again. I am cleaning the house and cooking again. I think there is hope for some real good times after all this even if my pain never really goes away. Or even if the cancer comes back. I think it may have all been worth it. ',\n",

My wife and I had to do very fucked up and very dark jokes just to retain what little sanity I was born with. It bothered so many people, but honestly, I didn’t give a fuck. My mental well being is more important than some old broad clutching her pearls. \\n\\nWhen people asked how my cancer was, or what the outlook was like, I would say in a light manner “well, I’m not dead yet but who knows what will happen tomorrow”, then depending on the person, I’d make some dark jokes based to that persons tastes. Ranging from me saying something like “well, I only accidentally shit myself twice last night in my sleep”(which people thought I was joking but i always told the truth), to “Well, we were deciding if (wife’s name) should spend money burying me in a proper graveyard, store me under our house, or trick my friends and family into drinking my ashes”, or other shit.  \\n\\nUntil you get to the point of “congrats, you’re in remission”, one of the few things that matters is your mental health. You need to stay strong mentally to have the will to keep fighting, dealing with chemo/radiation, or in your case, the stress of waiting in your cancer to grow(seriously, that really sucks. I hope that gets dealt with as fast as possible). You need to be able to keep waking up, keep eating, bathing, trying to stay as mentally alive as you can. \\n\\nI wish you the best and if you want to vent or want some fun shit to say to people, hit me up any time. Just as an example, something I personally find hilarious but a lot of people find offensive and have given me shit over is this joke where I ask someone if they want to know a good life hack, they always say yes, and I’ll go “Do your best to not get cancer”. Man, people take that so offensively. \\n\\nBut yeah, your mental health and sanity are more important.

They did the faeces investigation in a lab to check for bacteria, parasites (from swimming in open waters) and blood. They did 2 checks but found nothing. \\n\\nMy doctor made an appointment for me in the hospital to see a colon specialist but earliest free spot was 4 weeks waiting. \\n\\n2 weeks later I started to get have cramps and from Tuesday I could not go to the toilet anymore. Wednesday and Thursday night I was unable to sleep because of the cramps, Thursday  night I also started to vomit. Friday morning I went to see my doctor and she forwarded me to the emergency care of the hospital. \\n\\nThere they checked my blood and took scans of my stomach. Turned out I had a blockage in my colon and my colon was about to explode (stretched to 14 cm compared to the normal 3 cm). They had to do surgery straight away and removed a part from my colon and placed a stoma. \\n\\n4 days after surgery I could already leave the hospital because of a very good recovery.\\n\\nThey told me I had to come back for a few additional checks to find the cause of the blockage.\\n\\nLast week Monday I went to the hospital to see the results and then I got the news: colon cancer stage 4, with spreads over the liver.\\n\\n2 says later I had to see the cancer doctor, she told me they cannot cure it anymore. In best case if the chemo has a good affect on my body, they can try to stabilize it. \\n\\n3 days ago I went to another hospital to get a 2nd opinion (in the best cancer hospital in my country).  There they confirmed the first opinion.  I was hoping they could do surgery at my liver to remove the dots (in my colon the cancer was removed by surgery). \\n\\nBut they didn't really want to answer my questions and they said they will start with a months chemo (FOLFOX) treatment (every 2 weeks).  After 3 months they will do new scans to see the effect of the chemo on my liver. If the dots would have been shrinking or partially removed the can think about surgery (they told me). \\n\\nBut as they didn't want to go into details on surgery, I think this was just some BS and they will keep on giving my chemo till the end. \\n\\n5 year expectations for stage 4 colon cancer with spread to the liver:\\n\\n* with liver surgery: 74%\\n* without liver surgery: 7%\\n\\n  \\nSo I expect this is the end and I won't live much longer. \\n\\nQuite frustrating as I live super heathy: no smoking, drinking, drugs. Always very healthy food and I train 15-20h per week (swimming, running and cycling). \\n\\nI think my good health and physics might have masked some symptoms. I sometimes felt tired but who wouldn't if you work 40-45h  and do 15-20h of sports  per week.\\n\\n  \\nNo sure what to expect from the chemo who will start next week and how I will feel. I just hope I won't be too sick so I can still to some walks or other things.\\n\\nI just try to do only things which I really want to do and the hope I might have some happy moments now the end is near. \\n\\n  \\nBr\",\n",

       "      'content': 'Hey, wishing you the best!\\n\\nJust wanted to clarify that the statistics may be a little deceiving. No one usually gets the liver surgery right away. You have to demonstrate that the body as a whole is responding well to the chemo, and then that triggers the discussions among radiologists, surgeons and oncologists to devise a smart way to remove the spots. However, if your body doesn’t respond to the chemo, then that’s a sign that the surgery wasn’t going to help in the first place bc the cancer was spreading microscopically already to a point that the surgeon wasn’t going to visibly “see” all the cancer spots for surgery to be a successful procedure. Hope that helps rationalize why the chemo is step 1.  Also, this explains a bit better why the ones without surgery have worse statistical outcome—their cancer was already spreading in a more aggressive fashion. Again, wishing you the best!!',\n",

       "      'content': 'Hey there, \\n\\nI’m sorry this is happening to you. It’s terrible. I’m 27, stage IV colorectal and felt called to share my experience with you. When I was diagnosed I was deemed terminal, with mets to my lungs, liver, and hip bone. My liver was covered with innumerable lesions, the largest of which being around 11cm I believe. During my first conversation with an oncologist I was told I would be on chemotherapy the rest of my life, and that was that. No mention of surgery or other options. I was devastated, as I imagine you are, and terrified of course that I would die much sooner than planned. \\n\\nI’m still scared, but less so, and much has happened since then. I got a second opinion, during which the doctor brought up the possibility of surgery if chemo was effective enough. After a year of chemo we started to have discussions about whether the surgery could be done. My response to chemo was very good and I fully believe it’s because I was vigilant about my health during this time and prioritized my well-being over everything else. It took a lot of effort on my part and a lot of coordinating with many different surgeons before finding my surgeon (who was incredible by the way). This process took 5 months and was incredibly stressful because it felt like such a long shot and the odds were not in my favor, but in spite of everything they operated in June. I had the right lobe of my liver removed along with multiple spots ablated on the left lobe. The surgery was very intense and I had multiple complications, but I am finally back to a degree of normalcy a few months later and my liver is clean. \\n\\nBecause I had to take 6 months of chemo for the surgery, a few spots grew back in my lungs. I’m currently on chemo to resolve these spots. and then the plan is to do chemoradiation for my primary tumor, followed potentially by another surgery. The important distinction is that now the goals of my treatment are curative. In theory, if everything goes according to plan (and we know that it doesn’t always), I could be NED by the end of next year. The surgery has opened up new treatment pathways like immunotherapy as well. I’m not delusional, but I also have a degree of faith that while my life may not be as long as I hoped, I could very well surpass all the expectations that doctors had for me. \\n\\nThere’s a lot more I could share with you about my journey, please reach out if you want. The reason I am sharing is because I hope that this could give you some hope. It’s really important to have hope. If it could happen for me, it can definitely happen for you.',\n",

       "    'selftext': \"I'm beyond frustrated. It's taking *forever*—an entire month just to schedule a biopsy and get pathology results. I found out about a month ago that the chemo wasn't working anymore. Back in June, my scans were clear, but by September, the cancer was back, worse than before my last surgery in March. The plan was to explore clinical trials, but then we hit another roadblock: a new mass was found in my breast, completely unrelated to the ovarian cancer I've been dealing with.\\n\\nAn MRI in August came back with a BIRADS score of 4, which required further investigation. A biopsy was scheduled earlier this month, but during the ultrasound-guided procedure, the radiologist couldn't locate the suspicious mass from the MRI. He referred me to a breast surgeon instead, to spare me an unnecessary biopsy. Then, Hurricane Milton delayed my appointment with the specialist by another week.\\n\\nWhen I finally saw the surgeon, they did a punch biopsy, but today I got the call that the results were benign. It should have been good news, but the surgeon isn't satisfied with the sample—it was too small, and the area doesn’t match what the original MRI showed. Now, I need a mammogram-guided biopsy.\\n\\nI get that they want to be thorough, but this is what's standing between me and getting into clinical trials. I haven't had any treatment in two months, and that's too long to let the cancer keep growing. I just broke down trying to reach my oncology team to figure out how to speed this up without losing another month or two that I don’t have. I'm angry—at the system, at how long everything takes, at the sheer inefficiency of it all. It feels like my life is on hold, and time is running out.\\n\\nUpdate: A nurse coordinator helped speed things up, and I’m officially scheduled for a biopsy next week, followed by a follow-up the week after. There’s not much else I can do right now except to follow the plan that’s been set.\",\n",
