Or do that first, just be sure to do it. One company I interviewed with their recruiter told me to always find one if possible bc that is where they start the interviewing. I just searched job listings and would go to LinkedIn with whatever company and type in ""Company name"" recruiter and see who popped up and woild message them and ask if they would have 5 or 10 minutes to chat about open positions within their company that would match my background.

If you're not sure how",NEG,0.8853375911712646,"Just as background, I worked as a research nurse at a major academic medical center for 3 years. 

First, breathe. You are new. The first 6 months in any new job feel bad - overwhelming, stressful, aggravating, anxiety-inducing. You're learning new policies, new skills, new people, new studies, new ways of working, new routines. It will get better. Usually around 6 months things start to click faster and it starts to feel better - try to stick it out for at least that long.

Second, yes - there is *always* work to be done when you're working in clinical research. Start prioritizing what is urgent versus what can wait - and then let those things wait. Not every email needs an immediate response. If you're not sure how to break things down now into piles of ""needs to be done right away"" versus ""needs to be done this week"" versus ""can be done next week"" then ask your colleagues/mentor/whoever was training you to help, or ask your direct line manager to help you prioritize. I used to find it helpful to keep an agenda with a checklist for each day of the week - I would write out what needed to be done each day so that I'd know what I was doing and what I had ahead of me. It also helped me to know I wasn't losing track of anything.

You should not be routinely working over 40 hours in a week (assuming you're hired as full-time 40). Talk to your manager if you are.

Start saving language for some of those deviations or other regulatory submissions - you'll find you can reuse a lot of it with minor tweaks. Then you'll be able to pop out a submission like that in 5 minutes. In the same vein - as you get in the swing of things, you'll know better what sponsors want and won't have as many follow up questions/queries.",strongly negative

That's probably not what you want to hear but it's the truth. If you want to keep applying, look for site level roles and be willing to take the bottom of the barrel to get your foot in the door. Just be aware that these positions are often underpaid and understaffed. Academia is better than private clinics in general.

I was a freshman in college, already reeling from moving past my high school goals and struggling to make friends. I hadn’t figured out how to be a healthy, balanced person yet instead of the “go go go” 24/7 person I was before. 

Getting stuck at home for several months while I was already struggling was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I couldn’t tell you what month of lockdown things started, but I do know that before lockdown I never missed a single college class, I was getting things done early, working on fun projects, and volunteering. When I came back in Fall 2020, I could barely make it out of bed and couldn’t even make myself log onto a zoom class on my phone. 

The main things triggering me about the job are that I feel like I’ve already “disappointed” people, so my anxiety just kind of snowballs from there. And the layoffs, but that’s relatively new. It’s not what I wanted to do when I graduated, but I work with the most amazing people in the world, so they usually make up for things.

As for a sense of purpose, I don’t think I’ve genuinely felt one in a long time. I’m just kind of existing right now from one day to the next.
I didn’t think I’d make it past high school, and not in the usual way people mean that. I just planned everything I was going to do in high school to achieve my goals so meticulously and never bothered to even touch what came after. It’s just something I never put thought into at all, so I don’t feel like I’ve been “me” since graduating in 2019

Hearing about how the anxiety leads to the depression is really interesting. It sounds like you have two problems that strongly overlap. Mostly, I guess, it sounds like you aren't always very kind to yourself. Do you think that self-compassion is an option for you? I know it's hard to lean into if you're feeling like you aren't worth it, but I think you know in abstract that everyone deserves love, especially from themselves. 

Purpose is tricky. I have one, but I wouldn't be able to fully articulate it. I just know what I have to do, and it feels important. I do think it's nice to have a direction, if not a destination.

Obesity is strongly correlated with osteoarthritis (OA), particularly in the knees and hips. There are both mechanical and metabolic factors.

Observational studies have shown that each **5 kg/m²** increase in BMI is associated with a **35% increased risk** of knee OA.

Like that's literally the entire point. People eat way less on the drug (some people even report throwing up a bunch).


A really big issue is we really haven't done a great job of studying the physiological and neurological processes within food and obesity. 


We know men and women don't gain and lose weight the same way with the same ease. People who are high in testosterone prioritize muscle and performance, their body is more than happy to burn fat reserves in order to enable muscle repair after gym day. And muscle burns calories like crazy, so it means a week  from now the same amount of calories is creating less fat reserves in the first place,because the muscle is eating it up.Women's bodies are designed to withstand famine and be ready for a potential pregnancy. So women's bodies aren't as eager to burn fat stores, and they don't build muscle as rapidly


So men often tend to be able to drop weight very quickly and it's immediately noticable, they feel great. Women's weight loss tends to be much less of a straight line and tends to need to be done over a longer period. We also know exercise and nutritional recs from women should fluctuate with her cycle. You can make the process a lot harder than it needs to be by insisting on pretending women's physiology isn't different 


The issue is we are discovering there's very likely other variations between people between boy/girl. There are people who do appear to have a genetic predisposition to being famine ready. Just like there's people who think cilantro tastes like soap, there's people who's body seems to really really like carbs and sugars, whereas there's other people who have a fairly low ability to perceive bitterneness,which means they tend to find incorporating certain vegetables a lot easier etc.


You can't expect universal outcomes from a varied population. If you can go all day without eating and function, n awesome good for you. If someone else needs a drug to go all day without eating .....shouldn't you be happy they're willing to withstand the side effects of the drug so they can go all day without eating?

When a cyp is overactive, a drug will be converted really fast, meaning there will be a quick effect (and side effect) but no long lasting drug level will be achieved .",NEU,0.877346932888031,"We know which drugs are metabolized by which Cytochrome P450 enzyme subtypes(I'll call them ""cyps"" for short). Theres several hundreds of them, but some, like the subtypes 3A4 or 2D6 play a role in a lot of drugs. 

Some background regarding drug levels: You want a drug level in a steady state in most antidepressants and other long-term medication. This is achieved due to the fact that the drug isn't completetly cleared from the system before the next dose is given, meaning it will slowly rise until eliminiation time is equivalent to the daily intake. 

Now, how does this work?  
Theres two options. Option one: Some drugs need to be ""activated"" by enzymes, meaning that the drug itself needs to be converted by them to be effective (These are called ""pro-drugs""). When a cyp is overactive, a drug will be converted really fast, meaning there will be a quick effect (and side effect), but no long lasting drug level will be achieved. When the cyp is underactive, there won't be enough metabolization and the pro-drug will be cleared by kidney or liver before it can achieve a proper drug level.  
Option two: the drug is active and the Cyps will metabolize them to become inactive. In this scenario, overactive Cyps will lead to a faster clearance and no drug level will be achieved. Underactive Cyps can be really dangerous in this scenario: since they don't get metabolized, the drug will accumulate and can reach toxic levels. 

Some medications (or certain substances like grapefruit juice) can increase or decrease Cyp activity, which can lead to drug interactions. 

Your individual genetic Cyp profile can be determined and analyzed, but that can be rather complicated. Sometimes, by knowing how you have reacted to which drugs, you can assume to have a certain Cyp profile.",neutral

Also the antidepressants for example themselves can cause persistent anhedonia, blunting, sexual dysfunction. This was not accounted for.

Compared to western medicine where placebo effects are similarly powerful: [source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect#:~:text=A%20study%20published%20in%20Science,ingredients%20of%20a%20placebo%20effect)

>One group took a migraine drug labeled with the drug's name, another took a placebo labeled ""placebo,"" and a third group took nothing. The researchers discovered that the placebo was 50% as effective as the real drug to reduce pain after a migraine attack.

The effect of placebo is similarly powerful in western and eastern medicine, as is the benefit of real vs sham treatment. From a practitioner point of view the application of the placebo is particularly problematic, in western medicine, where the placebo process was created, the placebo should have almost no bodily effect, eg a sugar pill. In acupuncture, placing a needle in a body is going to have some effect, it may not be the same calming point but your body will still experience some stimulus from the application of the placebo. Instead of the sugar pill it's like giving someone a different medication entirely, which will sometimes be reported as working erroneously - ""Oh yeah, I feel different!""

>Many biochemical and signaling pathways have been identified as playing a direct role in how acupuncture achieves its clinical effects, but perhaps the most central pathway that acupuncture uses, one that helps explain how it is effective in such a diverse array of clinical areas, is that acupuncture has been demonstrated to directly initiate a process called purinergic signaling, a primitive14 and ubiquitous system in the body using adenosine and ATP for signaling and regulation in all tissues and organ systems.15 It is now understood that all nerve transmission requires ATP as a co-factor and the that the body uses purine levels as a primary background signal of both healthy function and tissue damage. Studies on mice demonstrate that those that were bred to be unable to bind to adenosine did not have pain relief from acupuncture nor any of the chemical changes associated with acupuncture pain relief, while the normal mice did16,17 and this effect was repeated in humans.18

For the acupuncture group, acupuncturists used disposable stainless steel needles of varying sizes depending on the acupoint and adhesive foam pads (diameter and depth, 10.0 × 5.0 mm) placed on the skin at acupoints (Suzhou Hwato Medical Instrument). For *GB30* and *BL36*, needles (0.3 × 75.0 mm) were inserted to a depth of approximately 40 to 50 mm, and for *BL25* and *BL26*, to approximately 30 to 40 mm. *De qi* sensation (soreness, numbness, distension, or heaviness) was achieved by up to 10 seconds of twirling, lifting, and thrusting manipulations, and was expected to radiate down to the affected leg. For other acupoints, needles (0.3 × 40.0 mm) were inserted to reach *de qi* sensation locally. Needles were retained in place for 30 minutes.

>For the sham group, acupuncturists used nonacupoints away from the meridians, which are considered to have no effect; this is common practice for sham controls in acupuncture research.[^(22)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2825064#ioi240067r22) **Seven nonacupoints were preset for sham acupuncture** (eFigure; eTable 3 in [Supplement 2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2825064#note-IOI240067-1)).

The aim of a sham is to help blind the patient so they don't know if they got the treatment or the control.

In this case however there was a big difference between treatment and sham. Treatment patients had multiple needles inserted into the skin and manipulation of those needles to induce a degree of pain/tingling in thst part of the body.

In the sham arm only one needle was actually inserted into the skin and no manipulation of if was performed. Patients would have been able to very easily tell if they received actual acupuncture or a sham treatment.

In essence this should be treated as an open label rather than blinded trial which leaves it open to placebo effects.

What's interesting is the decision to use a poor sham like this. It would have been very easy to do a good sham where you do everything the same except pick random points to insert the needles. Previous studies have done this. The deliberate choice of this sham really makes me wonder if the authors weren't trying to put their thumb on the scale here and generate a positive trial.

However I am also a clinical behaviourist and the term ""muscle memory"" is used to describe behaviours that the body no longer has to think about the movement for.


Typically we would say its when the physical pattern of behaviour (movement/muscle) is now processed in a different part of the brain for autonomic-esque responses. Because our brain always looks for the simplest way to get to A to B and will prefer well used pathways for efficiency.


So in fitness - when you first learn to deadlift you need to isolate the muscles and think and feel what each part of your body needs to do for the form. When deadlifting is a ""muscle memory"" your body already knows where it should be and all you need to essentially do is press the button and it will meet the action points youve installed over time.


Typically you can find that adding a new complex process (such as asking difficult maths questions) can derail these automatic-like tasks, because the brain relies on efficient pathways driven by set stimuli, and when the stimuli change the pathway needs to generalise the behaviour.


I am trying to simplify what happens, especially because its still not clear how every single bit of the body knows exactly what it needs to do at once. (Tho this study does suggest its not just brain!).

The ""actual conclusion"" is that it's poorly studied.  Considering [the replication crisis in psychology,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) so-called ""promising"" results that haven't been extensively replicated are worthless.  

> Hilarious that you think it's calling anything ""pseudoscience"" 

I didn't say that they did.  Since you're evidently incapable of not lying about what I actually said, this discussion is over.

> The fact is, EVERY treatment is psychiatry is at best ""contentious"" 

Yeah, but some are clearly gibberish and this is one of them.

Van der Kolk's ""The Body Keeps the Score"" depends upon [Stephen Porges's polyvagal theory, which is pseudoscience.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polyvagal_theory&oldid=1251888304)

> there is broad consensus among experts [...] that each basic physiological assumption of the polyvagal theory is untenable. Much of the existing evidence, upon which these consensuses are grounded, strongly indicates that the underlying polyvagal hypotheses have been falsified.

Van der Kolk's work is thus just more pseudoscience on top of pseudoscience.",strongly negative

The movement emphasizes strict sexual abstinence before marriage and advocates for traditional gender roles within marriage . Study found belief in certain purity culture principles was linked to both higher rates of sexual pain and lower satisfaction in marriages . Women who had never internalized these beliefs,NEU,0.8402215242385864,"From the article: A recent study [published](https://academic.oup.com/socrel/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/socrel/srae031/7863400) in the journal Sociology of Religion has revealed a connection between adherence to purity culture ideals and increased rates of sexual pain disorders among white American Christian women. The study found that belief in certain purity culture principles was linked to both higher rates of sexual pain and lower satisfaction in marriages. However, women who had never internalized these beliefs tended to have more satisfying relationships.

Purity culture gained prominence in American evangelical circles during the 1990s and 2000s. The movement emphasizes strict sexual abstinence before marriage and advocates for traditional gender roles within marriage. The ideology is centered around maintaining a woman’s “purity,” often framing premarital sex as damaging to a woman’s spiritual and physical well-being. This movement promotes the idea that women should preserve themselves as “gifts” for their husbands, discouraging behaviors deemed “provocative” to prevent inciting male desire.

In marriage, purity culture often portrays women as responsible for fulfilling their husbands’ sexual needs, teaching that it’s a wife’s duty to be constantly available to prevent marital problems. These teachings are frequently accompanied by metaphors, such as comparing women who have had premarital sex to “chewed-up gum” or “crumpled petals,” which can foster shame and guilt around sexuality, particularly for women.

The motivation behind the new study was to investigate the long-term effects of purity culture teachings on married women, specifically exploring the impacts on marital satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and sexual pain disorders. While purity culture’s rhetoric often focuses on abstinence and “saving oneself” for marriage, these teachings extend well beyond the wedding day, affecting how women view sex and their roles within marriage. Researchers Joanna Sawatsky, Rebecca Lindenbach, Sheila Wray Gregoire, and Keith Gregoire saw an important gap in understanding how these beliefs impact married women’s experiences.",neutral

Exclusive: Researchers find treatment plants designed to clean up leachate liquid waste boost levels of banned PFAS

Processes intended to decontaminate noxious liquid landfill waste before it enters rivers and sewers have been found to increase the levels of some of the worst toxic chemicals, a study has shown.

Landfills are well known to be a main source of PFAS forever chemicals – or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances – but the [new study](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/water/articles/10.3389/frwa.2024.1480241/abstract?utm_source=F-NTF&utm_medium=EMLX&utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE) shows that the treatment plants designed to clean up the liquid waste can instead boost the levels of banned PFAS such as PFOA and PFOS, in some cases by as much as 1,335%.

PFAS are a family of about 15,000 human-made chemicals with nonstick properties that are used in a wide range of consumer products and industrial processes. They can take thousands of years to break down in the environment and the handful that have been studied in detail have been found to be toxic, with PFOA and PFOS linked to cancers and other diseases. PFAS pollution is widespread, having been found in the remotest parts of the world, and it is thought every US citizen has it in their blood.

Using data from an Environment Agency investigation into landfill liquid waste, which is known as leachate, Dr David Megson from Manchester Metropolitan University, who co-authored the study found “that instead of removing the banned chemicals PFOS and PFOA our treatment plants are actually creating them … likely being formed from the transformation of other PFAS within a chemical soup”.",neutral

After it ended, I realized how much I was missing out on because my boyfriend and I were so so different in terms of what we enjoyed and who we were, that I wasn't doing the things that really made me happy, or if I was, I often felt guilty because it was so clear he wasn't enjoying them/didn't want to be there. When we broke up, I started traveling way more. I'd go out to lunch by myself, go to the beach by myself. I lived alone.

Abstract

The experience of singles has been largely overlooked in relationship science, garnering a need for understanding correlates of singles’ well-being. Gender is an important focus of well-being research, and qualitative work on singlehood has suggested that men and women may have experiences of singlehood that differ in important ways. In this study (N = 5941; 50% men; Mage = 31.74), we provide the first comprehensive, descriptive profile of gender differences on a suite of variables with important ties to well-being in singlehood; satisfaction with relationship status, life satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and desire for a partner. Our results suggest that single women, on average, report higher levels of satisfaction with relationship status, life satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and lower desire for a partner. Exploratory analyses showed significant gender interactions with age and ethnicity. Overall, these findings suggest that women are, on average, happier in singlehood than men.

From the linked article:

Why Women Like Being Single More Than Men Do

Women take to single life more readily than men, new research finds.

In Every Way, Women Were Happier Than Men with Their Single Lives

On every question that was asked in the study, single women were more comfortable than single men with their single lives. They were happier with their current romantic relationship status. They were less likely to want a romantic partner. They were more sexually satisfied. And they were more satisfied with their life in general.

Where single women really stood out from single men, and partnered women, was in their satisfaction with their romantic relationship status. On average, single life suits single women. They like it and they are not very interested in being in a romantic relationship.",neutral

The former blows off steam, the latter kind of does too but something about it gets you deeper.. it's a confronting of something not an avoiding of it.

I learned it from my female friends, and I feel more self-sufficient.. not less like wanting to share my time with someone, but less like wanting to waste it with someone who doesn't understand some things that are meaningful to me.

It's a somewhat different way of looking at what a relationship should be like - should feel like - and so I totally get why some people would rather be alone than with someone who can't meet them there, even just half way.

Guys aren't taught by our culture how to self-care, how to channel emotion in a way that confronts a problem, not avoid it. We just blow off steam without fixing the problem or even knowing what it is.

So IMO our culture doesn't give guys the tools to know what self care even looks like. Wild because guys love solving problems but we're so crap at our own.

Women get better messaging and more encouragement to express beauty and gentleness, caring and empathy, things we all need for ourselves but male culture makes it very hard for guys to get it for themselves. Just my 2c from experience.",moderately positive

Men's notable lack of friendship with other males is partly due to atomizing cultural tides that have affected everyone, but also due to systematic destruction of male-only spaces and activities .",NEU,0.5472896695137024,"Category error. Single has different meanings for men and women in Western countries. Some of these are cultural:

> oh I'm having sex with them but I'm still single. 

Is not a statement evenly distributed across both sexes. Therefore sexual satisfaction while 'single' will not be the same across both sexes. 

Other differences are material. Others in the thread have pointed out how women who are more emotionally satisfied within a committed relationship command more ability to be in one or start a new one if their existing partnership ends. But I would argue that this is true across the entire relationship spectrum from committed to frivolous. 

Thus, women, even outside of committed relationships, have much more power to achieve whatever type of non-committal sexual relationship(s) they find appealing week to week. So what you're really measuring, in part, is women's dominance of the sexaul marketplace. While interesting, it isn't exactly breaking new ground to notice this in 2024.

In regards to non-sexual relationships, there may be more fertile ground to play in academically. But we could at least notice that most exclusively male spaces and stereotypical activities have either been: 

* made illegal 

* delegitimized by being labelled toxic or problematic. 

* or face social pressure to allow women in.

Men's notable lack of friendship with other males is partly due to atomizing cultural tides that have affected everyone, but also due to a systematic destruction of male-only spaces and activities. The most notable of this being the workplace which used to be effectively 100% segregated. Even if men and women worked at the same companies, or even in the same department's and offices at those companies, they would rarely ever work closely together. However, this type of work environment is illegal in America (and most Western countries) post the civil rights regime of the 1960s and illegal to produce even by accident under modern court's interpretation of disparate impact. 

The gender segregated workplace has the honor of falling into all three categories listed above. It was made to allow women in by the force of law, and holdouts of male dominated workplaces face delegitimization efforts by being labelled problematic. Hence the term '____ bro' to describe finance and tech. And also Bernie supports who caught some strays (interesting sociological affect merits further study).",moderately neutral

Just off the cuff, my guess is that girls are more often ""parentified"" in their own homes as they grow up, which means they are places in more adult and responsible roles as far as chores and expectations. Boys, as they grow up, are generally treated the opposite and catered to more, so they have fewer skills that would allow them to live alone adequately.

That's a vast generalization and a guess, based on how one culture tends to do things. Then (in that specific culture) young women would have an easier time on their own, as it would be almost like a break from work; they'd be doing what they know, but only for themselves instead of for a household.

The authors used *linear regression* (???) on a dataset with two x-values (man = 1, woman = 2; assigning nonbinary individuals a numerical gender is problematic and it looks like the authors punted here) and made it very difficult for the reader to tease out the actual effect sizes, which again, seem to be small. Not even in the Supplementary Information are we offered a view into the actual stratified survey results by gender; the authors only provide regression parameters, and this adds to my suspicion that the findings are much less impressive if stated plainly. 

This joins a long parade of puffed-up social science ""disparity"" research which finds a statistically significant but small difference between groups and spins a long narrative yarn about the authors' political bugbear.

when my ex and I broke up we were still in regular contact for a few months. during this period we shared our experience using the same dating app. She was genuinely surprised when she found out that I only managed to get a match 1/10 times when swiping right, whereas she matches with every right wipe she made. She was genuinely puzzled because in her mind i’m an above average man in both looks and social status. It wasn’t until I explained to her the asymmetry of the sexual marketplace when it started to make sense to her.

in her own words dating as a single woman felt like doing online shopping. Just like picking new clothes on a webshop she might want to buy, the dating app felt like ‘picking’ men she might want to sleep with. 

For me the experience feels more like a game of chairs, where i’m lucky to be the ‘winner’ every now and then. And ‘win’ only secures me a match. Going on an actual date with said match is another added layer of chance.

In other words, dating for a single woman reflects a market of abundance, whereas for most men it’s existing in a market of scarcity. 

It’s that very scarcity that can make me anxious at times, because even though personally I don’t have as much trouble as many other men when it come to having sexual encounter, I do still feel like my chances of finding a long term romantic partner are relatively low, in part because I’m noticing a lot of the women i’ve been with since then often show a reluctance to become exclusive, presumably because of that very abundance they experience in online. 

They won’t say it outright, but I can imagine if you feel you can pick almost any man on these apps, intuitively why would she settle for me if tomorrow she could match with a guy with better looks and higher status?

In an ironic twist this emancipation + abundance for women has made me feel weirdly objectified during and after some of these sexual encounters.",neutral

When in reality, a lot of single women I know don’t have a huge circle of friends, and don’t do casual sex at all.

These guys’ line of thinking totally disregards the fact that in hookups, women statistically are still less likely to orgasm than the man, are the ones who bear the risk of unwanted pregnancy, and a lot of single women just aren’t hooking up nearly as much as men think (men seem to think “if I were a woman I’d have casual sex all the time because it would be so easy to find it” and don’t realize that a lot of women absolutely do not feel the same way). 

Anyway what I was getting at was that a lot of men don’t realize that many women are fine with being alone and even celibate because for some, the burden a relationship can become might not feel worth it.

Or are you trying to say, all the women are in relationships with the same ""top 10% of men"" who all go around having 10 girlfriends each?

How are there ever supposed to be ""far more"" single men? Where did they all come from, or where did all the extra women go?

Overall there's even more single women than men, because women live longer than men do on average. But the numbers are very equal, which kind of seems obvious.

There's only a difference if you look at very specific groups of people. For example 20 year old men are more likely to be single than 20 year old women. Why? Well because 40 year old men go around looking for 20 year old girlfriends. And 40 year old women do that to a far lesser degree.

Men may feel more agentic in pursuit of a relationship, are socialized to initiate in aspects of that relationship, and the pursuit may be influenced by sexual desire. I’d say that applies to me. Not to say that I only pursue relationships because of sexual desire, but if I’m single for a while I’ll probably feel more urge to go and make things happen and I know that sex is most often an aspect of a relationship that I desire. I don’t like casual sex and have never engaged in it, so I’m not trying to say that only men like casual sex or it’s because men are the only ones that want sex. 
 
Thinking of a friend I know, women who are single may feel less agentic in pursuit of a relationship less likely to initiate it, and more likely to wait until someone comes along. Because sexual desire may be less proactive, the proportion of intimacy they want to be fulfilled by sexual intimacy may be lower, and they’re able to get more needs met by friends.

It makes up the majority of the universe, but scientists don't know exactly what it is . A new study published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, Tarlé and colleagues from five institutions",NEU,0.950125515460968,"""Almost 14 billion years ago, at the very beginning of the Big Bang, a mysterious energy drove an exponential expansion of the infant universe and produced all known matter, according to the prevailing inflationary universe theory.

That ancient energy shared key features of the current universe’s dark energy, which is the largest mystery of our time by at least one objective standard: It makes up the majority—roughly 70%—of the universe, but scientists don’t know exactly what it is.

“If you ask yourself the question, ‘Where in the later universe do we see gravity as strong as it was at the beginning of the universe?’ the answer is at the center of black holes,” said [Gregory Tarlé](https://lsa.umich.edu/mira/people/faculty/gtarle.html), professor of physics at the University of Michigan and co-author of the study. “It’s possible that what happened during inflation runs in reverse, the matter of a massive star becomes dark energy again during gravitational collapse—like a little Big Bang played in reverse.”

In a new study published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, Tarlé and colleagues from five institutions are strengthening the case for this scenario with recent data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. DESI is made up of 5,000 robotic eyes mounted on the Mayall telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory on the land of the Tohono O’odham Nation.""

A study published in *The International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine* found a positive link between omega-3 intake and improved cognitive abilities in adults over 60. By analysing dietary and cognitive test data from 2,430 older adults, researchers discovered that those with higher omega-3 intake performed better in memory, executive function, and processing speed. The results indicated that moderate levels of omega-3 offered the most significant benefits, while excessive amounts provided limited additional improvements. The study suggests that omega-3 could be a beneficial dietary factor for cognitive health, although more research is needed to confirm a causal relationship. The article does not specify the dosages involved.



**Appropriate Dosage Levels:** 

While the article provides no guidelines on dosage, Omega-3 dosage recommendations generally focus on the combined intake of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), two essential omega-3 fats. Moderate intakes of 500 to 1,000 mg daily are often recommended for cognitive benefits, typically achievable through a balanced diet that includes fish or supplements.

If you drink 3-4 nights a week thiamine supplementation might also be broadly useful to you.

If you have compulsive/impulsive  thoughts n-aceytl-l cysteine out performs placebo by a bit for both and is broadly well tolerated and accessible. However this is one someone should research a bunch before, and much like how creatine is broadly studied and safe (creatine also helps you lose less congnitive function from sleep deprivation) it can make your tummy feel weird at first and that sucks more for some people who have Chrons/IBS/Autism and such.

Obviously comprehensive lifestyle changes are awesome and should be sought. But lifestyle changes are hard for valid reasons and reasons that might be personally valid but socially not seen as valid.

Researchers found that people with higher fluid intelligence, a form of general reasoning ability, were more likely to adjust their attitudes after receiving corrective information. Interestingly, an individual’s motivation to think deeply—what psychologists call “need for cognition”—had little effect on attitude change. This suggests that the ability to reason through new information is more influential than simply being motivated to engage with it.

The rise of misinformation, particularly online, has posed serious challenges for societies aiming to foster well-informed public discourse. In recent years, efforts to combat misinformation have often focused on fact-checking and correction strategies, but not all individuals respond to corrections in the same way. Understanding why some people adjust their beliefs while others do not could help improve debunking strategies.

The study’s authors wanted to explore whether personal characteristics like fluid intelligence (the ability to think and reason quickly and abstractly) or need for cognition (the desire to engage in effortful thinking) could predict who is more likely to update their attitudes in response to corrected information.",positive

There is little evidence for a higher-order intelligence factor.",NEU,0.9172296524047852,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312005843

From the General Discussion section:

""The results presented here provide evidence to support the view that human intelligence is not unitary but, rather, is formed from multiple cognitive components. These components reflect the way in which the brain regions that have previously been implicated in intelligence are organized into functionally specialized networks and, moreover, when the tendency for cognitive tasks to recruit a combination of these functional networks is accounted for, there is little evidence for a higher-order intelligence factor. Further evidence for the relative independence of these components may be drawn from the fact that they correlate with questionnaire variables in a dissociable manner. Taken together, it is reasonable to conclude that human intelligence is most parsimoniously conceived of as an emergent property of multiple specialized brain systems, each of which has its own capacity.

Historically, research into the biological basis of intelligence has been limited by a circular logic regarding the definition of what exactly intelligence is. More specifically, general intelligence may sensibly be defined as the factor or factors that contribute to an individual’s ability to perform across a broad range of cognitive tasks. In practice, however, intelligence is typically defined as “g,” which in turn is defined as the measure taken by classical pen and paper IQ tests such as Raven’s matrices (Raven, 1938) or the Cattell Culture Fair (Cattell, 1949). If a more diverse set of paradigms are applied and, as a consequence, a more diverse set of first-order components are derived, the conventional approach is to run a second-order factor analysis in order to generate a higher-order component. In order for the battery to be considered a good measure of general intelligence, this higher-order component should correlate with “g” as measured by a classical IQ test. The results presented here suggest that such higher-order constructs should be used with caution. On the one hand, a higher-order component may be used to generate a more interpretable first-order factor solution, for example, when cognitive tasks load heavily on multiple components. On the other hand, the basis of the higher-order component is ambiguous and may be accounted for by cognitive tasks corecruiting multiple functionally dissociable brain networks. Consequently, to interpret a higher-order component as representing a dominant unitary factor is misleading.""

""Indeed, from a phenomenological perspective, the idea that tasks tend to corecruit multiple functional brain networks makes intuitive sense, as generating a task that depends on any single cognitive process is likely to be rather intractable. Consider a simple working memory task, in which the spatial locations of a sequence of flashes must be observed, maintained, and repeated (spatial span). Even in this simple context, the participant must comprehend the written instructions, otherwise, they may report the correct locations but in the incorrect sequence. More importantly, people often apply chunking strategies when encoding information in short-term memory in order to generate a more efficient memory trace. For example, they may note that the flashes form the outline of a geometric shape. Such “chunking” strategies are a form of logical transformation and are known to recruit the IFS (Bor et al., 2001). Thus, even in the most simple of task contexts, all three of the cognitive systems identified in the current study would play a role but to varying extents.""

I agree that a consensus among psychologists is not nearly as valuable as a consensus among, say, physicists. But it's certainly more valuable than the common belief of laypeople.

Regarding the study you cited: Hampshire 2012 fractionates intelligence into short-term memory, reasoning, and verbal. It's fMRI support for a distinction that has long been made between memory/attention, fluid/analytic intelligence, and crystallized/practical intelligence.

Yes, working memory of course affects performance on cognitive tasks, which are used to assess IQ. So does sleepiness. And motivation. But these are considered distinct concepts, not aspects of intelligence. When possible, their influence is regressed out.

Yes, intelligence can be divided into fluid and crystallized. (That's why OP's study specifies.) Some believe these are fully independent and cite anatomy, and some believe these overlap enough that we might as well just use *g* and cite behavioral correlation. Either way, it remains the case that IQ is a useful metric.

Yes, it's imperfect. All metrics are. Your blood pressure, the one they take at the doctor's office? It's actually specific to location on the body, current position, time of day, and mood.

Of course, that can't be easily demonstrated in a Reddit comment, and it's quite possible you and others would know better than I could surmise. It's also reasonably possible that they've been underestimated.

Also, note that the cited section's point about working memory in cognitive tests was pointing out properly understanding the question, not working memory as a variable — both of which could reasonably be said to significantly correlate with intelligence, but it's hard to imagine researchers could control for all non-intelligence related variables very well. I unfortunately cannot demonstrate that, but I suspect that you and many others could not demonstrate it's not the case. (Not just meaning in the limited space of social media comments.)

There are tons of physisicts that really suck at statistics even after years of training but nobody would call them unintelligent for that alone.

I use Eric Wong's Ultimate MMA Strength and Conditioning program. I heard about it when I was going to an MMA gym in Hamilton, Ontario (Joslins). There's actually four cycles to it: Corrective Phase, Base Conditioning Phase, Strength Phase, and Power Phase. Each phase has two distinct routines that you alternate between for about 4 weeks before moving to the next one. Corrective phase is only needed the first time around to fix any muscle discrepancies or you can revisit it if you think you're lacking something. 

There are also cardio/conditioning blocks associated with each phase but I tend to just incorporate long runs into my routine these days because I'm not competing in combat sports any more but I like the program for the weight lifting aspects since it keeps me doing a variety of exercises and a lot of good core stuff. 

Eric also has a lot of great programs for pain related to hips, shoulders, wrists, lower back, and a bunch of other areas as well as programs for flexibility, mobility, etc. I can only speak to my own experience but I have done some hip programs of his and found them more effective and comprehensive than the physio I was seeing at the time.",neutral

In terms of ethics we can make stem cells out of normal adult cells, so the ethical debate around them has kind of dried up.

One of the main challenges is simply that turning a stem cell into each different cell type requires a completely different process. Making them functional and mature is really, really, really difficult. We can make pretty good muscle cells by over expressing a single gene, but it takes more to make them adult, working, contracting muscle cells that form big functional fibres. 

AI might be able to help with this part, the way genes get turned on or off to determine what cell type they become is often obscenely complicated. Taking lots of genetic data and using AI to find how all these genetic networks fit together is an area where GPTs might actually excell, it's being worked on and some early models with small sequencing datasets are coming out. 

Another issue is scale up, growing some of these cells in a flat dish is relatively simple these days. But a single-cell thick sheet isn't very helpful. Growing actual tissue on a larger scale is a big issue. How do you grow a big lump of tissue while getting nutrients and oxygen to the cells inside? How do you actually connect that lump to a living person? 

There's all sorts of research going on with scaffolds to support the growth of cells in 3D to achieve this. Or even growing cells in living animals that can use their blood supply.

It's a problem also shared with the lab grown meat industry, most companies in that space are capable of making good enough quality muscle and fat cells, but doing that at large scale efficiently is an entirely different challenge.",neutral

But a deep understanding of this structure has been lacking. Now scientists at the University of California, Davis have identified new clusters of cells with differing patterns of gene expression in the amygdala of humans and non-human primates. The work could lead to more targeted treatments for disorders such as anxiety that affect tens of millions of people. 

>The researchers searched for specific cell types that expressed the genes implicated in anxiety and other disorders in humans. This strategy can help identify cell types that are most likely to give rise to psychopathology, Fox said. 
>
>For example, they identified a specific group of cells that expressed a gene called FOXP2. The new study shows that in humans and macaques, FOXP2 is expressed in cells on the edges of the amygdala, called intercalated cells. Excitingly, researchers have demonstrated that in rodents, this small group of FOXP2-expressing cells play a role as “gatekeepers,” controlling signal traffic in or out of the amygdala. Together, these data suggest intercalated cells to be a potentially powerful avenue for developing treatments.

>The researchers were also able to identify both similarities and differences between cell types in the human and non-human primate amygdala. This is important for understanding how discoveries in animal models of disorders such as anxiety and autism relate to humans. 
>
>The approach could help identify cell types as potential drug targets. For example, FOXP2-expressing cells tend to express both anxiety-related genes and a receptor that can be targeted by drugs, called Neuropeptide FF Receptor 2 (NPFFR2). This result can guide the development of new treatment strategies, by suggesting drugs that activate the NPFFR2 pathway as a potential treatment target in relation to anxiety-related disorders.

From the linked article: 

Does masculinity shorten lifespans? This study suggests ‘manly’ men at higher risk of heart problems

Men who strongly conform to traditionally masculine behaviors are significantly less likely to receive crucial diagnoses and treatment for serious cardiovascular conditions, according to new research. The study suggests that societal pressure on men to appear tough and self-reliant may be literally putting their hearts at risk.

Researchers from the University of Chicago say this pattern begins as early as adolescence and continues into adulthood, potentially putting these men at greater risk for future cardiovascular problems. Their study, published in JAMA Network Open, followed over 4,000 American men from their teenage years through early adulthood, examining how their degree of “male gender expressivity” (MGE) – essentially, how closely they conform to typical male behavioral patterns – affected their likelihood of being diagnosed with and treated for conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes.

The research team found that men who displayed higher levels of masculine behavior were significantly less likely to receive diagnoses for these conditions, even when medical tests showed they had them. For instance, among men with elevated blood pressure, those with higher MGE scores were 4% less likely to receive a hypertension diagnosis. The effect was even more dramatic for diabetes, where men with higher adolescent MGE scores were 15% less likely to receive a diagnosis when their blood sugar levels indicated they had the condition.

Perhaps most troubling, even when these men did receive diagnoses, they were less likely to follow through with treatment. Among men who had already received a hypertension diagnosis, those who displayed more masculine behaviors in adolescence were 11% less likely to take prescribed blood pressure medications. Similarly, men showing higher masculine traits in young adulthood were 7% less likely to take blood pressure medications and 10% less likely to take diabetes medications when diagnosed with these conditions.

“Our hypothesis is that social pressures are leading to behavioral differences that impact cardiovascular risk mitigation efforts, which is concerning because it could be leading to worse long-term health outcomes,” Glasser adds.",strongly negative

When it comes to the cholesterol that matters, you produce all you need (and don't need) on your own. Studies generally don't support a causative link between dietary cholesterol intake and cardiovascular risk, and organizations are finally dropping dated recommendations, as the AHA did in 2019; one coverage piece here:

https://www.endocrinologyadvisor.com/news/american-heart-association-issues-science-advisory-on-dietary-cholesterol/

The most important dietary factors appear to be general overeating (obesity is a major input) and intake of *specific* SFAs — not all ""saturated fat"" is created equal and lumping SFAs in *unprocessed* animal products together with processed and industrial SFAs (especially industrial trans fats, which are/were *very* bad) does a severe disservice to the available evidence.

https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.05.077

In the overall context of hypercholesterolemia, it seems entirely plausible that the easier contributions of processed grains to overeating and overweight status would be larger indirect contributors than the equivocal risks with minimally processed animal products. It's enormously difficult to draw formal conclusions given how mixed up all the data necessarily is, though.

If, for instance, men try being kind to women and it ends up not getting him what he desires out of the interaction then they're going to learn that being kind doesn't work and they're not going to do that anymore. If a man feels led on and used they're going to actively avoid doing it. If men are paying a woman's way, giving them attention, giving them validation and they get back none of what they want from the interactions then they're going to feel used and stop doing those things altogether. Women teach men to be domineering, not to be kind, to act controlling and make demands because that's what produces the results they're looking for.

If men are domineering and women simply reject them for it instead of letting them take them out repeatedly and pay their way then that's an improvement for men. They're free to move on to the next woman quickly and at little cost until it does work for them.

If women wanted men to be kind to them they would make being kind have better results than being domineering but that's not what we see in reality. In reality kindness costs time and money, you need to invest in the other person and every step a man takes in that direction the more they're going to expect in return. If they don't get what they want in return over time they're going to recognize that it doesn't work and try other things. Maybe they'll ask other men what works for them and you know what works? Being dominant. That's what successful men tell other men. Women who don't want a dominant guy aren't going to want to be around you so they'll just reject you, which is fine, no big deal, guys don't care about rejection, it's a constant, they'll just move on to the next one and the next and the next, ... Until it does work for them and they find a woman who will accept their dominant demeanor and then they can get what they want and decide to be kind or not afterwards.

The reason why it works doesn't matter, men might have different theories on why it works, like women unknowingly want it, but that's just an irrelevant detail because it does produce results. 

Being domineering takes little time, energy, or money, you can be domineering towards a dozen women every day and experience no negative consequences, as opposed to being kind and investing in a woman which takes much time, energy and money and has no greater chance of success while also limiting the number of attempts a man can make.",neutral

However, as is the case with many things, eating too much of it is bad for you. Despite the strong evidence associating red meat with some cancers, the underlying mechanism is less clear.

Now, [researchers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38885349/) from the National Cancer Center Singapore (NCCS), together with scientists from Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), have identified the mechanism linking the excessive consumption of red meat to colorectal cancer.

Worldwide, colorectal cancer, which affects the large intestine or rectum, is the third most common cancer, accounting for around 10% of cancer cases. It’s also the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. In addition to age and family history, lifestyle factors such as diet, inactivity, obesity, smoking, and excess alcohol consumption can increase the risk of this type of cancer.

Using fresh colorectal cancer samples, the researchers discovered that the iron in red meat reactivated the enzyme telomerase via an iron-sensing protein called Pirin, which drove the progression of the cancer. Now, this requires stepping back to explain the importance of telomerase and telomeres and their relation to cancer growth.",neutral

Animal foods tend to be richer in heme iron, but [apparently these also contain some non-heme iron](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK540969/#:~:text=Red%20meat%2C%20poultry%20) (which is typically found more abundantly in plants). So it's possible that it's just the amount of iron present total, and it's also possible that they contain a higher ratio of heme iron. I can't tell that from the database though, since it doesn't break out types of iron.

It does make me wonder what we see in populations that eat a lot of mussels and clams, though. Would they have higher risk, or are the populations that eat a lot of mussels also eating a lot more fiber and doing other things that reduce risk?

A mutation activating telomerase takes out one of these failsafes and is present in ~90% of cancer cells. 

When telomerase is active and lengthening telomeres they are no longer protected, as they usually are. These free ends can fuse together, combining chromosomes which causes big issues during cell division. And they are recognised as broken strands by the cell's DNA repair mechanisms, where it will try and 'fix' these breaks. This all creates a lot of genome instability which will lead to further mutations and cancer.

This accumulation of mutations is what they mean when they talk about 'other genetic factors'.
Telomerase activation alone doesn't immediately cause a cell to become cancer, it requires other mutations. But it being active massively increases the likelyhood of a cell bcomeing cancerous, a lot of the time because of the genomic instability it's activation leads to.",strongly negative

In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:

[https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.069820](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.069820)

Conclusions:

Study findings reiterate the importance of exercise for BP control, suggesting that small additional amounts of exercise are associated with lower BP in a free-living setting.

From the linked article:

Five minutes of exercise a day could lower blood pressure

New research suggests that adding a small amount of physical activity – such as uphill walking or stair-climbing – into your day may help to lower blood pressure.

The study, published in *Circulation,* was carried out by experts from the [ProPASS (Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting and Sleep) Consortium](https://www.propassconsortium.org/), an international academic collaboration led by the University of Sydney and [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (UCL).

Just five minutes of activity a day was estimated to potentially reduce blood pressure, while replacing sedentary behaviours with 20-27 minutes of exercise per day, including uphill walking, stair-climbing, running and cycling, was also estimated to lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in blood pressure.

“The finding that doing as little as five extra minutes of exercise per day could be associated with measurably lower blood pressure readings emphasises how powerful short bouts of higher intensity movement could be for blood pressure management.”

The research team analysed health data from 14,761 volunteers in five countries to see how replacing one type of movement behaviour with another across the day is associated with blood pressure.",moderately positive
science,volunteer,SaltZookeepergame691,"People who did more exercise had lower blood pressure, obviously . They define the smallest *clinically meaningful* difference in blood pressure as 2 mmHg SBP and 1mmHg DBP . This cutoff is based on previous trials showing this reduction is the smallest that is associated with a benefit for cardiovascular health .",NEU,0.7181970477104187,"I'm not going to argue that anyone should get less exercise (they should get more) or that exercise isn't beneficial (it is) but this sort of science is deeply limited and the headline is misleading.

They gave 12,000 people a thigh acceloromator for 24 h and measured their activity, and their blood pressure.

People who did more exercise had lower blood pressure, obviously.

They define the smallest *clinically meaningful* difference in blood pressure as 2 mmHg SBP and 1 mmHg DBP - this cutoff is based on previous trials showing this reduction is the smallest that is associated with a benefit for cardiovascular health.

Now, note that they are NOT following people over time to see if changes in exercise cause changes in blood pressure. No. They are just comparing a big group of people who exercised more on a single day with those who exercised less on a single day, and trying to *control* stratistically for all the other differences that also affect blood pressure - things like jobs, diets, education, stress, alcohol, drugs, sleep, smoking, etc. Note that they actually can only adjust for self-reported age, sex, alcohol, smoking, plus in some cohorts education and job status and disability.

So how much exercise was associated with a *clinically meaningful* difference in blood pressure, after trying to control for age, sex, alcohol, smoking, and some other bits?

>Clinically meaningful improvements in SBP and DBP were estimated after 20 to 27 minutes and 10 to 15 minutes of reallocation of time in other behaviors into additional exercise.

This means converting 15 minutes of standing a day into exercise could be associated with a 1 mmHg decrease in DBP, and changing 27 minutes of sleeping into exercise might be associated with a 2 mmHg decrease in SBP.

5 minutes of exercise replacing sedentary behaviour was estimated to be associated with a –0.68 mmHg decrease in SBP, but there was a wide margin of error of –0.15 to –1.21. For DBP, it was –0.54mmHg (margin of error –0.19 to –0.89).

TL;DR:

What does this really mean? It means adding 5 minutes of exercise would have no discernibly meaningful impact on your blood pressure and thus on your risk of cardiovascular disease. We should not be sending a message that 5 minutes exercise is adequate for blood pressure reduction.",neutral

Over a year ago I was diagnosed with stage 4 HNSCC and given a median survival of 12-18 months. I got temporary palliative chemo benefit after being told that surgery and radiation was inappropriate for how advanced the cancer was- that my quality of life for my remaining time would be much better if we didn’t subject me to the surgery/radiation side effects. I completed 1st line chemo/immuno at a highly regarded NCI center where I received excellent care, followed by off label chemo that kept things fairly stable with unacceptable side effects.

I agreed to enter as ADC trial at MD Anderson in hopes of trading up to more tolerable side effects. 4 weeks ago my Oncologist walked in and said, “I think we are 2 treatments away from REMISSION”.
We said “that never happens with this advanced cancer”. She said it has been happening with this drug. Even if I never get remission I feel way better than I have since first diagnosed, gaining weight, enjoying food, and waking up looking forward to the day.

We are in a golden era of cancer research and you get to decide whether to join those of us choosing to jump from lily pad to lily pad, or whether you want to draw the line at standard approved treatment followed by palliative care. There are of course multiple factors that make either choice appropriate for a given individual- and of course there are risks to minimally tested drugs that you assume once all standard measures have failed and the cancer is winning . I am enjoying life too much now to choose Palliative Care/Hospice- but that could change next week or next month.

Hope this helps.",neutral

It is about quality of life and accepting that immortality isn’t in the cards for any of us.

You could do what I do and ask yourself daily- was today worth it?  For now it is easy. Later, maybe not so much.

What makes it even more interesting is that we sometimes tend to revert to the mean with good things and bad things in life (the fancy sports car just becomes your car, the vomiting around chemo days is just your new lifestyle- although cumulative fatigue of the side effects bugs me more some days than others).

Finally, the happiness literature distinguishes immediate happiness from the remembered self or remembered happiness.  An interesting distinction but I will spare you that rabbit hole.

I believe that having gratitude for the amazing improbable life we have had as we walk our last mile is perhaps the most important other element to consider. If we are truly at peace with the life we have had, are ok with not waking up tomorrow because of that gratitude, have our “affairs in order”, and understand that immortality isn’t in the cards, then we are not grasping for something we haven’t yet accomplished as the next lily pad option presents itself- so it becomes a much cleaner assessment of quality of life with the inevitable side effects that come with putting poison in your body (in hopes of knocking back cancer and having more time with loved ones).

All of this to say, when you enter a study and your assessment is that the travel, side effects, uncovered expenses, opportunity cost of what else you could be doing with that time,… make for an unacceptable quality of life, you are free to drop out of the study and enter the next phase of your cancer journey (palliative care, hospice, or whatever).

Now the hard part, your daughter is clingy because you are the center of her world. She knows and feels something is not right. She may not be able to verbalize it but it's there. She is clingy because she loves you and knows you take care of her.  Please take into consideration how messed up the rest of her life will or could be without you in it. Kids grow into adults and the trauma of losing a parent no matter the reason creates the same doubts and fears you are having now. 

I am not blaming you in any way for those thoughts we all have them when dealing with cancer as a patient.

Coming here to ask a question was a smart thing so keep coming back. There is support here and if you decide to share your general location folks will do their best to find you and direct you to help.

Do you have a Cancer Center/house in your area? A great place for help is Area agency on aging I know it sounds like it for seniors, but they have a wealth of info and they will help. Call your oncologists office and speak with the resource person and tell them what's going on. You would be surprised what they can do for you. 

The folks in this sub are the best and sharing stories with them and vice versa lets you know you're not Alone. Isolated maybe but not alone.

And I suppose it could be different depending on diagnosis, etc but I get PET CT  scans (abdominal and chest with both oral and IV contrast) fairly routinely and am specifically allowed clear liquids, specifically described as ""water, tea and *coffee without milk*"", up to an hour before the scans.

I see most of the answers you got seem to adhere to ""no coffee"" (very adamantly at that) before the scans but it's confusing to me. Are you (and anyone else) told to abstain from coffee for longer than an hour prior to your scans? Or is it just that you wanted milk in your coffee?

Here is a screenshot of the instructions for my next scans (this week). I'm really curious if others are receiving dramatically different instructions. I'm at a large and highly acclaimed cancer center so don't have any reason to doubt the docs/techs here but am so curious about why I seem to have different prep instructions.

The only thing that kept me sane was dark humour. My wife and I had to do very fucked up and very dark jokes just to retain what little sanity I was born with. It bothered so many people, but honestly, I didn’t give a fuck. My mental well being is more important than some old broad clutching her pearls. 

When people asked how my cancer was, or what the outlook was like, I would say in a light manner “well, I’m not dead yet but who knows what will happen tomorrow”, then depending on the person, I’d make some dark jokes based to that persons tastes. Ranging from me saying something like “well, I only accidentally shit myself twice last night in my sleep”(which people thought I was joking but i always told the truth), to “Well, we were deciding if (wife’s name) should spend money burying me in a proper graveyard, store me under our house, or trick my friends and family into drinking my ashes”, or other shit.  

Until you get to the point of “congrats, you’re in remission”, one of the few things that matters is your mental health. You need to stay strong mentally to have the will to keep fighting, dealing with chemo/radiation, or in your case, the stress of waiting in your cancer to grow(seriously, that really sucks. I hope that gets dealt with as fast as possible). You need to be able to keep waking up, keep eating, bathing, trying to stay as mentally alive as you can. 

I wish you the best and if you want to vent or want some fun shit to say to people, hit me up any time. Just as an example, something I personally find hilarious but a lot of people find offensive and have given me shit over is this joke where I ask someone if they want to know a good life hack, they always say yes, and I’ll go “Do your best to not get cancer”. Man, people take that so offensively.

You have to demonstrate that the body as a whole is responding well to the chemo, and then that triggers the discussions among radiologists, surgeons and oncologists to devise a smart way to remove the spots. However, if your body doesn’t respond to the chemo, then that’s a sign that the surgery wasn’t going to help in the first place bc the cancer was spreading microscopically already to a point that the surgeon wasn’t going to visibly “see” all the cancer spots for surgery to be a successful procedure.

Let me ease your mind on cytostaika - aka chemo.

I was in more or less the same spot as you - no symptoms, no pain. Healthy lifestyle. And then I got a persistent dry cough. Thanks to my hypochondriac daughter I went to see the local physician. 

A slight cough and some elevated blood pressure turned in to a remiss to a diagnostics specialist that turned in to a full circus. To the point, that when I was admitted, one of the doctors straight out said that if I'd had a seizure then and there - they wouldn't revive me. He also told me that I wasn't in the process of dying. Straight forward MoFo.  

And that was my sob story. Now to you. 

Don't fear chemo. It's not what it's like in TV or movies. I'm on the second day of my third treatment as I write and - yes, my cocktail will make my fingers extremely sensitive to cold - for the first few days. Constipation - a side effect that I've prepared for. And the nausea? No. You get meds to counter that as well.

>!I'm not trying to promote or influence in any way or form. This is just for information. In Sweden I get to take 12 Betapred (cortison), 1 Omeprazol (to counter the cortison),1 Desloratidin (anti-nausea) and 2 Ondasetron (antihistamin) before getting a Oxaliplatin/Calciumfolinate/Flouroracil coctail. This is pre-treatment. Post-treatment I take 1 Desloratidin after treatment and one on the day after and the day after that.!<

It doesn't make me fell sick - at all. Counting down from treatment, day 6,7 and 8 I've got 20%, 10% and 0% energy. And I'm old enough to listen to my body - 0 energy? Stay in bed, read a book. The week after - I go ride my bike. The only restriction is no Grape Fruit. And that sucks, as I love  GF.

I’m sorry this is happening to you. It’s terrible. I’m 27, stage IV colorectal and felt called to share my experience with you. When I was diagnosed I was deemed terminal, with mets to my lungs, liver, and hip bone. My liver was covered with innumerable lesions, the largest of which being around 11cm I believe. During my first conversation with an oncologist I was told I would be on chemotherapy the rest of my life, and that was that. No mention of surgery or other options. I was devastated, as I imagine you are, and terrified of course that I would die much sooner than planned. 

I’m still scared, but less so, and much has happened since then. I got a second opinion, during which the doctor brought up the possibility of surgery if chemo was effective enough. After a year of chemo we started to have discussions about whether the surgery could be done. My response to chemo was very good and I fully believe it’s because I was vigilant about my health during this time and prioritized my well-being over everything else. It took a lot of effort on my part and a lot of coordinating with many different surgeons before finding my surgeon (who was incredible by the way). This process took 5 months and was incredibly stressful because it felt like such a long shot and the odds were not in my favor, but in spite of everything they operated in June. I had the right lobe of my liver removed along with multiple spots ablated on the left lobe. The surgery was very intense and I had multiple complications, but I am finally back to a degree of normalcy a few months later and my liver is clean. 

Because I had to take 6 months of chemo for the surgery, a few spots grew back in my lungs. I’m currently on chemo to resolve these spots. and then the plan is to do chemoradiation for my primary tumor, followed potentially by another surgery. The important distinction is that now the goals of my treatment are curative. In theory, if everything goes according to plan (and we know that it doesn’t always), I could be NED by the end of next year.

Also, stage 4 isn’t necessarily terminal. For many it just means not curable so you’ll treat cancer like a chronic illness that will require constant treatment. To help keep positive lean on the Lord. Also check out this guy’s videos, it’ll help you maintain hope during treatment:

Some people choose to just keep going in their usual manner prior to the dx. Some people begin researching and adding what they believe will assist them. I've certainly changed some of the things I do along with chemo.

One of those for me is higher dose Omega 3s for inflammation. Higher dose vitamin D as its linked with slowing progression. These are just a couple strategies I've employed that may or may not alter my cancer story but they don't hurt me and I feel good taking them.

By the way.. Cherry juice has been associated with lowered BP, has numerous antioxidants, and anti cancer benefits. There are many substances that scientists have proven have a beneficial effect for cancer patients and/or the cancer itself. Obviously it's important to discuss with the oncology team prior to starting any supplemental items.
